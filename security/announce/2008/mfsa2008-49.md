title: Arbitrary code execution via Flash Player dynamic module unloading

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An anonymous security researcher reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that insufficient checks were being performed to test
whether the Flash module was properly dynamically unloaded.
The researcher demonstrated that a SWF file which dynamically unloads
itself from an outside JavaScript function can cause the browser to access
a memory address no longer mapped to the Flash module, resulting in a
crash.  This crash could be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code
on a victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>
