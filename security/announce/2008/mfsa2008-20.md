title: Crash in JavaScript garbage collector

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fixes for security problems in the JavaScript engine described in 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-15.html">
MFSA 2008-15</a> (CVE-2008-1237) introduced a stability problem, where some
users experienced crashes during JavaScript garbage collection. This is being
fixed primarily to address stability concerns. We have no demonstration that
this particular crash is exploitable but are issuing this advisory because
some crashes of this type have been shown to be exploitable in the past.</p>

<p class="note">This regression was introduced in Firefox 2.0.0.13 and does
not affect any shipping version of Thunderbird. Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 contains
the correct fix for MFSA 2008-15, although as noted in that advisory
Thunderbird users would be vulnerable only if they had enabled JavaScript.
</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.</p>
