title: Script access to .documentURI and .textContent in mail

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Boris Zbarsky</strong> reported that a
malicious mail message might be able to glean personal information
about the recipient from the mailbox URI (such as computer account
name) if the mail recipient has enabled JavaScript in mail.  If a
malicious mail is forwarded "in-line" to a recipient who has enabled
JavaScript, then comments added by the forwarder could be accessed by
scripts in the message and potentially revealed to the original
malicious author if that message has also been allowed to load remote
content.</p>

<p>Scripts in mail messages no longer have access to the DOM properties
<code>.documentURI</code> and <code>.textContent</code>.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird is only vulnerable to this issue if
JavaScript is enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we
strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>
