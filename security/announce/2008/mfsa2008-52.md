title: Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.0.4/1.8.1.18)

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser
engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume
that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could be
vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default
setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out the possibility that for
some of these an attacker might be able to prepare memory for exploitation
through some means other than JavaScript such as large images.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.</p>
