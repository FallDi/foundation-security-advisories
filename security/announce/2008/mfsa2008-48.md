<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Georgi Guninski, Michal Zalewski, Chris Evans<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey<br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Georgi Guninski</strong> reported that
the canvas element could be used in conjunction with an HTTP redirect
to bypass same-origin restrictions and gain access to the content in
arbitrary images from other domains.  This vulnerability could be used
by an attacker to steal private information from a victim who is
logged into a website that stores the data in images.</p>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Michal Zalewski</strong>
and <strong>Chris Evans</strong> also reported an additional threat
caused by this vulnerability in which an attacker can enumerate the
software installed on a victim's computer by using moz-icon as the
redirection target.</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue.</p>
