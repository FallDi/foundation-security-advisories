title: XSS vulnerabilities in SessionStore

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported
vulnerabilities in the session-restore feature by which content could be
injected into an incorrect document storage location, including
storage locations for other domains.  An attacker could utilize these
issues to violate the browser's same-origin policy and perform an XSS
attack while SessionStore data is being restored.</p>

<p>moz_bug_r_a4 also reported that one variant could be used by an
attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript or the session-restore feature until a version
containing these fixes can be installed.</p>
