<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Collin Jackson</strong> and
<strong>Adam Barth</strong> reported a series of vulnerabilities which
allow JavaScript to be injected into the context of signed JARs and
executed under the context of the JAR's signer.  This could allow an
attacker to run JavaScript in a victim's browser with the privileges
of a different website, provided the attacker possesses a JAR signed
by the other website.</p>

<p>One variant allowed JavaScript to be injected into documents inside
a signed JAR file.  An additional vulnerability exploited signed JAR files
which use relative URLs to JavaScript files. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to trick the browser into treating an attacker-controlled
JavaScript file as the file the signed JAR intended to reference.</p>
