title: Compartment mismatch re-attaching XBL-backed nodes

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Sachin Shinde</strong> reported that moving
certain XBL-backed nodes from a document into the replacement document
created by <code>document.open()</code> can cause a JavaScript
compartment mismatch which can often lead to exploitable conditions.
</p>
<p>Starting with Firefox 20 this condition was turned into a run-time
assertion that would crash the browser in an unexploitable way, and in
Firefox 24 the underlying cause was fixed.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
