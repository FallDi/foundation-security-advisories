title: Execution of unmapped memory through onreadystatechange event

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Nils</strong> reported that specially crafted web
content using the <code>onreadystatechange</code> event and reloading of pages
could sometimes cause a crash when unmapped memory is executed. This crash is
potentially exploitable.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
