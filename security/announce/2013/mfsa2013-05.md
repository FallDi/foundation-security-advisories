title: Use-after-free when displaying table with many columns and column groups

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher <strong>Atte Kettunen</strong> from OUSPG discovered that the combination of large numbers of columns and column groups in a table could cause the array containing the columns during rendering to overwrite itself. This can lead to a user-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
