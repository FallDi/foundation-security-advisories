title: Document URI misrepresentation and masquerading

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported that
through an interaction of frames and browser history it was possible to make the
browser believe attacker-supplied content came from the location of a previous
page in browser history. This allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by
loading scripts from a misrepresented malicious site through relative locations
and the potential access of stored credentials of a spoofed site.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
