title: Bypass of SOW protections allows cloning of protected nodes

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Cody Crews</strong> reported a mechanism to use the <code>cloneNode</code> method to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) and clone a protected node. This allows violation of the browser's same origin policy and could also lead to privilege escalation and the execution of arbitrary code.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
