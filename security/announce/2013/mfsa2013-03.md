<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>miaubiz</strong> used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer overflow in Canvas when specific bad height and width values were given through HTML. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash. 
</p>

<p>Miaubiz also found a potentially exploitable crash when 2D and 3D content was mixed which was introduced during Firefox development and fixed before general release.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
