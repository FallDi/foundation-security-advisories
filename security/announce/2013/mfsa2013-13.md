title: Memory corruption in XBL with XML bindings containing SVG

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Sviatoslav Chagaev</strong> reported that when using an XBL file containing multiple XML bindings with SVG content, a memory corruption can occur. In concern with remote XUL, this can lead to an exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
