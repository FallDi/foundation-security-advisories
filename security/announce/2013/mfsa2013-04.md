title: URL spoofing in addressbar during page loads

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Masato Kinugawa</strong> found a flaw in which the displayed URL values within the addressbar can be spoofed by a page during loading. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
