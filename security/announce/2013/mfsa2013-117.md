<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Google</strong> notified Mozilla that an intermediate
certificate, which chains up to a root included in Mozilla&#8217;s root store, was
loaded into a man-in-the-middle (MITM) traffic management device. This
certificate was issued by Agence nationale de la s&#233;curit&#233; des syst&#232;mes
d'information (ANSSI), an agency of the French government and a certificate
authority in Mozilla's root program. A subordinate certificate authority of
ANSSI mis-issued an intermediate certificate that they installed on a network
monitoring device, which enabled the device to act as a MITM proxy
performing traffic management of domain names or IP addresses that the
certificate holder did not own or control.</p>

<p>The issue was not specific to Firefox but there was evidence that one of the
certificates was used for MITM traffic management of domain names that the
customer did not legitimately own or control. This issue was resolved by
revoking trust in the intermediate used by the sub-CA to issue the certificate
for the MITM device.
