<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Seamonkey<br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compiler Engineer <strong>Dan Gohman</strong> of Google reported that binary
search algorithms in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine were prone to overflow
in several places, leading to potential out-of-bounds array access. While none
of these are known to be directly exploitable, they are unsafe in theory and
have been changed as part of general security improvements. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
