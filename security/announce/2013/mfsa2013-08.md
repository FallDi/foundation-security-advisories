title: AutoWrapperChanger fails to keep objects alive during garbage collection

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Olli Pettay</strong> discovered that the AutoWrapperChanger class fails to keep some javascript objects alive during garbage collection. This can lead to an exploitable crash allowing for arbitrary code execution.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
