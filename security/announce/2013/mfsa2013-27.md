title: Phishing on HTTPS connection through malicious proxy

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Google security researcher <strong>Michal Zalewski</strong> reported an issue
where the browser displayed the content of a proxy's 407 response if a user
canceled the proxy's authentication prompt. In this circumstance, the addressbar
will continue to show the requested site's address, including HTTPS addresses
that appear to be secure. This spoofing of addresses can be used for phishing
attacks by fooling users into entering credentials, for example.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
