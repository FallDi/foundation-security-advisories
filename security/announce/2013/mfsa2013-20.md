<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Google</strong> reported to Mozilla that TURKTRUST, a certificate authority in Mozilla&#8217;s root program, had mis-issued two intermediate certificates to customers. The issue was not specific to Firefox but there was evidence that one of the certificates was used for man-in-the-middle (MITM) traffic management of domain names that the customer did not legitimately own or control. This issue was resolved by revoking the trust for these specific mis-issued certificates.
