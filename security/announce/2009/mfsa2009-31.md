title: XUL scripts bypass content-policy checks

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla add-on developer and community member <strong>Wladimir
Palant</strong> reported that content-loading policies were not
checked before loading external script files into XUL documents.
The severity of this problem would depend on the reasons behind the
content policy check, which include privacy from "web bugs" in
Thunderbird mail messages, blocking of Ads and Ad-server tracking
in AdBlock Plus.</p>

<p class="note">The original version of this advisory incorrectly claimed
that NoScript protection could by bypassed; NoScript was unaffected.</p>
