<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jeremy Brown</strong> reported that the
file naming scheme used for downloading a file which already exists in
the downloads folder is predictable.  If an attacker had local access
to a victim's computer and knew the name of a file the victim intended
to open through the Download Manager, he could use this vulnerability
to place a malicious file in the world-writable directory used to save
temporary downloaded files and cause the browser to choose the
incorrect file when opening it.  Since this attack requires local
access to the victim's machine, the severity of this vulnerability was
determined to be low.</p>
