title: URL spoofing with invisible control characters

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla contributor <strong>Masahiro Yamada</strong> reported that
certain invisible control characters were being decoded when displayed
in the location bar, resulting in fewer visible characters than were
present in the actual location.  An attacker could use this
vulnerability to spoof the location bar and display a misleading URL
for their malicious web page.</p>

<p class="note">The initial version of this advisory incorrectly listed
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey as affected products. Firefox is the only
product affected by this vulnerability.</p>
