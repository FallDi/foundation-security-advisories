title: Directives to not cache pages ignored

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Paul Nel</strong> reported that certain HTTP directives to
not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control:
no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by Firefox 3.  On a
shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP directives could
potentially expose private data.  Another user on the system could use
this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages containing private
data by navigating the browser back.</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 2 releases are not affected.</p>
