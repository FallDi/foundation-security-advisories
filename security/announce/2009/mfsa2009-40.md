title: Multiple cross origin wrapper bypasses

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported
a series of vulnerabilities in which objects that normally receive
a <code>XPCCrossOriginWrapper</code> are constructed without the
wrapper.  This can lead to cases where JavaScript from one website may
unsafely access properties of such an object which had been set by a
different website.  A malicious website could use this vulnerability
to launch a XSS attack and run arbitrary JavaScript within the context
of another site.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing this fix can be
installed.</p>
