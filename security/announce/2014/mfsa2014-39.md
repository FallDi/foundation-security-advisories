title: Use-after-free in the Text Track Manager for HTML video

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher <strong>Abhishek
Arya</strong> (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team found a
use-after-free  in the Text Track Manager while processing HTML video. This was
caused by inconsistent garbage collection of Text Track Manager variables and
results in a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
