title: XSLT stylesheets treated as styles in Content Security Policy

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security engineer <strong>Frederik Braun</strong> reported an issue
where the implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) is not in compliance
with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/">specification</a>. XSLT stylesheets
must be subject to <code>script-src</code> directives but Mozilla's
implementation of CSP treats them as styles. This could lead to unexpected
script execution if the <code>style-src</code> directives were less restrictive
than those for scripts.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Seamonkey product because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a
risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
