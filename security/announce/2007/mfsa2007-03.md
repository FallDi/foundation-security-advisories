<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-03</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      Information disclosure through cache collisions<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Moderate<br/>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  February 23, 2007<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Aad<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, SeaMonkey<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 2.0.0.2<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Firefox 1.5.0.10<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      SeaMonkey 1.0.8</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Aad</strong> reported that two web pages can collide in the disk cache
with the result that depending on order loaded the end of the longer
document can be appended to the shorter when the shorter is reloaded from
the cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted
attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page (for example,
transaction history from a financial account). The potential victim would
have to be already logged into the targeted service (or be fooled into doing
so) and then visit the malicious site.</p>

<p>We have not calculated how much effort would be required to compute a colliding
URL on a different host from the target page.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Temporarily set the disk cache size to zero (0) in the preferences until you can
upgrade to a fixed version.</p>
