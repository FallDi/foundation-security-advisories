title: onUnload Tailgating

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Michal Zalewski</strong> demonstrated that onUnload event
handlers had access to the address of the new page about to be loaded,
even if the navigation was triggered from outside the page content
such as by using a bookmark, pressing the back button, or typing an
address into the location bar. If the bookmark contained sensitive
information in the URL the attacking page might be able to take advantage
of it. An attacking page would also be able to redirect the user,
perhaps to a phishing page that looked like the site the user thought
they were about to visit.</p>
