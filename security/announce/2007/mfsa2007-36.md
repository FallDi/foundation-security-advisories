title: URIs with invalid %-encoding mishandled by Windows

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>On Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 installed several "web related"
URI schemes do not launch the registered protocol-handler if the URI contains
an invalid %-encoded sequence. This was initially reported by
<strong>Billy Rios</strong> and <strong>Nate McFeters</strong>
with additional investigation by <strong>Secunia</strong>. A patch
that mitigated the known exploits was shipped with Firefox 2.0.0.6
as described at <a href="mfsa2007-27">MFSA 2007-27</a>.</p>

<p>That mitigation did not prevent the incorrect file-handling programs
from launching which left some risk. An additional fix has been
applied to Firefox 2.0.0.8 that detects when Windows would mishandle
these URIs so that the wrong program does not get launched.</p>
