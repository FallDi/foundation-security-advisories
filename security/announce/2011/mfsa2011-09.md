<span class="label">Announced:</span>  March 1, 2011<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Jordi Chancel<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Thunderbird<br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> reported that a
JPEG image could be constructed that would be decoded incorrectly,
causing data to be written past the end of a buffer created to store
the image.  An attacker could potentially craft such an image that
would cause malicious code to be stored in memory and then later
executed on a victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 3.5 was not affected by this issue.</p>
