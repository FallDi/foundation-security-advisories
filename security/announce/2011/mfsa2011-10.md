<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Independent security researcher <strong>Kuza55</strong> and
Microsoft security researcher <strong>Tom Gallagher</strong> reported
that when plugin-initiated requests receive a 307 redirect response,
the plugin is not notified and the request is forwarded to the new
location.  This is true even for cross-site redirects, so any custom
headers that were added as part of the initial request would be
forwarded intact across origins.  This poses a CSRF risk for web
applications that rely on custom headers only being present in
requests from their own origin.</p>
