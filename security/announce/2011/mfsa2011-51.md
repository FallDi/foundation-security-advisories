title: Cross-origin image theft on Mac with integrated Intel GPU

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Claus Wahlers</strong> reported that random images from GPU memory
were showing up in WebGL textures. Once incorporated into the WebGL graphics it
is possible for a site to programatically read the image data and potentially
gain sensitive data from other things that had been displayed earlier. This
problem is due to a bug in the driver for Intel integrated GPUs on recent
Mac OS X hardware, and the problem can be seen in WebGL implementations from
other vendors. Mozilla has implemented a work-around to prevent this from
happening with this hardware-driver combination.
