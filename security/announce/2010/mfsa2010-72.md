title: Insecure Diffie-Hellman key exchange

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla cryptographer <strong>Nelson Bolyard</strong> reported that
the SSL implementation was permitting servers to use Diffie-Hellman
Ephemeral mode (DHE) with too short of a minimum key length.  DHE keys
of such lengths are trivially breakable on modern hardware so SSL
servers operating in this mode were providing very little effective
security for their clients.</p>
