<span class="label">Title:</span>      XSS via plugins and unprotected Location object<br/>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     High<br/>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  March 23, 2010<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Blake Kaplan<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox 3.6<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 3.6.2<br/>
</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Blake Kaplan</strong> reported that the <code>
window.location</code> object was made a normal overridable JavaScript object
in the Firefox 3.6 browser engine (Gecko 1.9.2) because new mechanisms
were developed to enforce the same-origin policy between windows and frames.
This object is unfortunately also used by some plugins to determine the page
origin used for access restrictions. A malicious page could override this
object to fool a plugin into granting access to data on another site or the
local file system. The behavior of older Firefox versions has been restored.
</p>

<p class="note">This flaw does not affect earlier versions of Firefox, or other
programs such as Thunderbird or SeaMonkey built on older versions
of the browser engine.
