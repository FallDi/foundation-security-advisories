title: XSS via plugins and unprotected Location object

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Blake Kaplan</strong> reported that the <code>
window.location</code> object was made a normal overridable JavaScript object
in the Firefox 3.6 browser engine (Gecko 1.9.2) because new mechanisms
were developed to enforce the same-origin policy between windows and frames.
This object is unfortunately also used by some plugins to determine the page
origin used for access restrictions. A malicious page could override this
object to fool a plugin into granting access to data on another site or the
local file system. The behavior of older Firefox versions has been restored.
</p>

<p class="note">This flaw does not affect earlier versions of Firefox, or other
programs such as Thunderbird or SeaMonkey built on older versions
of the browser engine.
