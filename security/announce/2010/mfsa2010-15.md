<span class="label">Announced:</span>  March 23, 2010<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Justin Dolske<br/>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Justin Dolske</strong> reported that the new
asynchronous Authorization Prompt (HTTP username and password) was not
always attached to the correct window. Although we have not
demonstrated this, it may be possible for a malicious page to convince
a user to open a new tab or popup to a trusted service and then have
the HTTP authorization prompt from the malicious page appear to be
the login prompt for the trusted page. This potential attack is greatly
mitigated by the fact that very few web sites use HTTP authorization,
preferring instead to use web forms and cookies.</p>

<p class="note">This issue does not affect older versions of Firefox or
products based on the Mozilla browser engine, such as Thunderbird and
SeaMonkey, using an older version of the engine. </p>
