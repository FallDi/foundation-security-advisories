title: Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:1.9.2.9/ 1.9.1.12)

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Peter Van der Beken, Jason Oster, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov,
Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong and Olli Pettay reported memory safety
problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5.</p>
