title: XSS using addEventListener and setTimeout on a wrapped object

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reports that
by using an appropriately wrapped object it was possible to bypass the fix
for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-19.html">
MFSA 2007-19</a>. Prior to Firefox 3.6 this gives an attacker the ability
to perform cross-site scripting attacks against arbitrary sites as in the
original MFSA 2007-19 attack. Due to unrelated changes in the browser engine
used by Firefox 3.6, attacks in that version are limited to capturing keystroke
events from a cross-origin frame or window rather than full DOM access.
Those events might be sufficient to illicitly obtain passwords
or other sensitive information entered into web forms.
</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird does not allow JavaScript to run in mail
messages, but users who open web content (such as RSS feeds, or other
content through add-ons) could be at risk.
