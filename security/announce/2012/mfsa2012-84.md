title: Spoofing and script injection through location.hash

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> reported an issue with
spoofing of the location property. In this issue, writes to
<code>location.hash</code> can be used in concert with scripted history
navigation to cause a specific website to be loaded into the history object. The
baseURI can then be changed to this stored site, allowing an attacker to inject
a script or intercept posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
