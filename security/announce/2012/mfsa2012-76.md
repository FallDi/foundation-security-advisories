title: Continued access to initial origin after setting document.domain

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Collin Jackson</strong> reported a violation of
the HTML5 specifications for <code>document.domain</code> behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a new
<code>document.domain</code> but the observed violation allowed pages to retain
access to windows from the page's initial origin in addition to the new
<code>document.domain</code>. This could potentially lead to cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
