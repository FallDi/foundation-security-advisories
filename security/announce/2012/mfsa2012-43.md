title: Incorrect URL displayed in addressbar through drag and drop

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mario Gomes</strong> andresearch firm
<strong>Code Audit Labs</strong> reported a mechanism to short-circuit page
loads through drag and drop to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This
causes the address of the previously site entered to be displayed in the
addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This could lead to potential
phishing attacks on users.
