title: window.fullScreen writeable by untrusted content

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Matt Brubeck</strong> reported that
window.fullScreen is writeable by untrusted content now that the DOM fullscreen
API is enabled. Because window.fullScreen does not include
mozRequestFullscreen's security protections, it could be used for UI spoofing.
This code change makes window.fullScreen read only by untrusted content, forcing
the use of the DOM fullscreen API in normal usage.
</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability.
