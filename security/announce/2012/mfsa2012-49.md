<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Bobby Holley</strong> found that same-compartment
security wrappers (SCSW) can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW, but have a filtering
policy built into them. When an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is
stripped off and, when the object is read read back, it is not known that SCSW
was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of SCSW. This could result in
untrusted content having access to the XBL that implements browser
functionality.
