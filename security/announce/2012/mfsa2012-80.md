title: Crash with invalid cast when using instanceof operator

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Ms2ger</strong> reported a crash due to an
invalid cast when using the instanceof operator on certain types of JavaScript
objects. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
