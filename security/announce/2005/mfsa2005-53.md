title: Standalone applications can run arbitrary code through the browser

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several media players, for example Flash and QuickTime, support scripted content
with the ability to open URLs in the default browser. The default behavior for
Firefox was to replace the currently open browser window's
content with the externally opened content. If the external URL was a javascript:
url it would run as if it came from the site that served the previous content, which
could be used to steal sensitive information such as login cookies or passwords.
If the media player content first caused a privileged chrome: url to load then
the subsequent javascript: url could execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>External javascript: urls will now run in a blank context regardless of what
content it's replacing, and external apps will no longer be able to load
privileged chrome: urls in a browser window. The -chrome command line option
to load chrome applications is still supported.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Set the browser to open external links in a new tab or new window.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Options dialog from the Tools menu</li>
<li>Select the Advanced icon in the left panel</li>
<li>Open the "Tabbed Browsing" group</li>
<li>Set "Open links from other applications in:" to either new tab or new window</li>
</ol>
