products: Firefox, Mozilla Suite
reporter: moz_bug_r_a4
severity: High
title: XHTML node spoofing

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Parts of the browser UI relied too much on DOM node names without taking
different namespaces into account and verifying that nodes really were
of the expected type. An XHTML document could be used to create fake 
&lt;IMG&gt; elements, for example, with content-defined properties that the
browser would access as if they were the trusted built-in properties of the
expected HTML elements.</p>

<p>The severity of the vulnerability would depend on what the attacker could
convince the victim to do, but could result in executing user-supplied
script with elevated "chrome" privileges. This could be used to install
malicious software on the victim's machine.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>
