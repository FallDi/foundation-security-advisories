title: Install source spoofing with user:pass@host

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The installation confirmation dialog shows the source of the software.
By adding a long, fake "user:pass" in front of the true hostname the
user might be convinced to trust software that comes from an untrustworthy
source. This is similar to attempts used in some phishing mail:
"http://www.mozilla.org@attacker.com/install.xpi".</p>

<p>By default Firefox only allows install attempts from http://update.mozilla.org,
a user would need to explicitly allow the spoofing host to initiate
installs before it could try this trick.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not install software when prompted by untrusted sites. Enlarge
the install confirmation dialog and verify that "@" does not
appear before the first "/" character.</p>
