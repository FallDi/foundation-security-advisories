title: Script-generated event can download without prompting

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Script-generated click events were indistinguishable from true clicks.
Combined with the Firefox Alt+click feature that downloads links to 
the default location without prompting this could be used by malicious
sites to place executables or other malware onto a windows user's desktop
without their knowing, or simply attempt to fill their disk.</p>

<p>Mozilla 1.7.5 was also fixed to distinguish synthetic from true clicks,
but didn't suffer from unprompted downloads.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable javascript or upgrade to fixed version.</p>
