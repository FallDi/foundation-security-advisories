title: Secure site lock can be spoofed with view-source:

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Kohei Yoshino reports the secure site lock icon can be spoofed by using
a view-source: URL targetted at the secure site whose credentials you want
to appropriate. An insecure page of the attackers choice can then be loaded
while the lock icon shows the previous secure state.</p>
    
<p>This could potentially be abused by phishers to make their fake login sites
appear more authentic.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to fixed version</p>
