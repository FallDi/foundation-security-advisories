title: MFSA 2005-59: Command-line handling on Linux allows shell execution

<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2005-59</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      Command-line handling on Linux allows shell execution<br/>
<span class="label">Severity:</span>   Severe<br/>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Peter Zelezny<br/>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, Thunderbird, Mozilla Suite<br/>
<br/>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 1.0.7<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Thunderbird 1.0.7<br/>
<span class="label">&#160;</span>      Mozilla Suite 1.7.12</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>URLs passed to Linux versions of Firefox and Thunderbird on the command-line were
not correctly protected against interpretation by the shell. As a result
a malicious URL can result in the execution of shell commands with
the privileges of the user. If Firefox is set as the default handler for
web URLs then opening a URL in another program (for example, links
in a mail or chat client) can result in shell command execution.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not click on links in spam or other mail from people you don't know.
Do not use the affected programs as the default handler for URLs.
Upgrade to the fixed versions.</p>
