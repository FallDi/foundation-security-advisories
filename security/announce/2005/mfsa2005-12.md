title: javascript: Livefeed bookmarks can steal cookies

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Earlier versions of Firefox allowed <code>javascript:</code> and 
<code>data: URLs</code> as Livefeed bookmarks. When they updated the URL 
would be run in the context of the current page and could be used to 
steal cookies or data displayed on the page.</p>

<p>If the user were on a page with elevated privileges (for example,
<code class="filename">about:config</code>) when the Livefeed was updated, 
the feed URL could potentially run arbitrary code on the user's machine.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not add non-http URLs as a Livefeed bookmark. Upgrade to the fixed 
version</p>
