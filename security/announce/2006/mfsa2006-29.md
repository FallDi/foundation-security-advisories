title: Spoofing with translucent windows

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An interaction between XUL content windows and the new faster history
mechanism in Firefox 1.5 caused those windows to become translucent.
This could be used to construct spoofs that could trick users into
interacting with browser UI they can't see. It's possible a
clever game-type presentation could persuade an unsuspicious
user into some combination of actions that would result in
running the attacker's code.</p>

<p>Firefox 1.0 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not vulnerable.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable the faster back/forward history:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter "about:config" into the location bar and hit Enter</li>
  <li>Enter "sessionhistory" into the "Filter" text box</li>
  <li>Double-click on <code>browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers</code></li>
  <li>Change the default "-1" to "0" and hit the OK button</li>
</ol>
