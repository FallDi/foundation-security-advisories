title: PAC privilege escalation using Function.prototype.call

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>moz_bug_r_a4 reports that a malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could
serve a PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by
setting the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on
a privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox. By redirecting
the victim to a specially-crafted URL -- easily done since the PAC script
controls which proxy to use -- the URL "hostname" can be executed as
privileged script.</p>

<p>A malicious proxy server can perform spoofing attacks on the user so
it was already important to use a trustworthy PAC server.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable Proxy AutoConfig (the default setting). If that is impractical
ensure that the PAC server and proxy you use are trustworthy and reached
over a trusted network. Do not use the WPAD setting if you have a mobile
computer that is ever used outside of the trusted network (such as at
a WiFi hotspot).</p>
