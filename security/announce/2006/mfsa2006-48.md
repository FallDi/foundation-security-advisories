title: JavaScript new Function race condition

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>H. D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to trigger a race
condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a temporary
variable still being used in the creation of a new Function object.
The resulting use of a deleted object may be potentially exploitable
to run native code provided by the attacker.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.</p>
