title: Heap buffer overwrite on malformed VCard

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A VCard attachment with a malformed base64 field (such as a photo) can
trigger a heap buffer overwrite. These have proven exploitable in the
past, though in this case the overwrite is accompanied by an integer
underflow that would attempt to copy more data than the typical machine
has, leading to a crash.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Turn off the in-line display of attachments and do not click on
or open VCard attachments until you upgrade to a fixed version.</p>
