title: XUL tree removal crash and remote code execution
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>regenrecht</strong> reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that XUL &lt;tree&gt; objects could
be manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the
object would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause
certain sections of deleted memory to be accessed.  In products based on
Gecko version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer
this memory has been overwritten by a value that will cause an
unexploitable crash. In products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,
Thunderbird 3.0, and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could
potentially use this vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run
arbitrary code on their computer.</p>
