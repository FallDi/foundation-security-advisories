title: Crash and remote code execution using HTML tags inside a XUL tree
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>wushi</strong> of team509 reported that
when a XUL tree had an HTML &lt;div&gt; element nested inside a
&lt;treechildren&gt; element then code attempting to display content
in the XUL tree would incorrectly treat the &lt;div&gt; element as a
parent node to tree content underneath it resulting in incorrect
indexes being calculated for the child content.  These incorrect
indexes were used in subsequent array operations which resulted in
writing data past the end of an allocated buffer.  An attacker could
use this issue to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on
their machine.</p>
