title: Use-after-free crash in HTML parser

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Alin Rad Pop</strong> of Secunia
Research reported that the HTML parser incorrectly freed used memory
when insufficient space was available to process remaining input.
Under such circumstances, memory occupied by in-use objects was freed
and could later be filled with attacker-controlled text.  These
conditions could result in the execution or arbitrary code if methods
on the freed objects were subsequently called.</p>
