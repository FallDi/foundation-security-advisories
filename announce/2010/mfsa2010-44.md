title: Characters mapped to U+FFFD in 8 bit encodings cause subsequent character to
  vanish
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>O. Andersen</strong> reported that
undefined positions within various 8 bit character encodings are
mapped to the sequence U+FFFD which when displayed causes the
immediately following character to disappear from the text run.  This
could potentially contribute to XSS problems on sites which expected
extra characters to be present within strings being sanitized on the
server.</p>
