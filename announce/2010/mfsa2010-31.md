title: focus() behavior can be used to inject or steal keystrokes

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Google security researcher <strong>Michal Zalewski</strong>
reported that <code>focus()</code> could be used to change a user's
cursor focus while they are typing, potentially directing their
keyboard input to an unintended location.  This behavior was also
present across origins when content from one domain was embedded
within another via an iframe.  A malicious web page could use this
behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim while they were typing
sensitive information such as a password.</p>
