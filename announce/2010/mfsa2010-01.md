title: Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.1.8/ 1.9.0.18)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Henri Sivonen, Boris Zbarsky, Zack Weinberg, Bob Clary, Martijn Wargers, and Paul
Nickerson reported crashes in the browser engine.</p>
