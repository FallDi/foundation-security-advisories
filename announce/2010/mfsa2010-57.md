title: Crash and remote code execution in normalizeDocument
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>regenrecht</strong> reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize a
document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
arbitrary code.  When the normalization code ran, a static count of
the document's child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
the execution of attacker-controlled memory.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript or install NoScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>
