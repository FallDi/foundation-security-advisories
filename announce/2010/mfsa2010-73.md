<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Morten Kr√•kvik</strong> of Telenor SOC reported an exploit
targeting particular versions of Firefox 3.6 on Windows XP that
Telenor found while investigating an intrusion attempt on a customer
network. The underlying vulnerability, however, was present on both
the Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6 development branches and affected all
supported platforms.</p>

<p class="note">Reading mail in Thunderbird does not pose a risk to
users, however the vulnerability is present and could be triggered in
RSS feeds if JavaScript is enabled or by an add-on that enables
browser-like functionality.</p>
