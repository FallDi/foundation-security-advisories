title: SSL wildcard certificate matching IP addresses
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Richard Moore</strong> reported that
when an SSL certificate was created with a common name containing a
wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL connection could be
established with a server whose IP address matched the wildcard range
by browsing directly to the IP address. It is extremely unlikely that
such a certificate would be issued by a Certificate Authority.</p>
