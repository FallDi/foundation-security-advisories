<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Sergey Glazunov</strong> reported that
it was possible to access the <code>locationbar</code> property of
a <code>window</code> object after it had been closed.  Since the
closed <code>window</code>'s memory could have been subsequently
reused by the system it was possible that an attempt to access
the <code>locationbar</code> property could result in the execution of
attacker-controlled memory.</p>
