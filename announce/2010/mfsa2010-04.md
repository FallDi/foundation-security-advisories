title: XSS due to window.dialogArguments being readable cross-domain
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Hidetake Jo</strong> of Microsoft
Vulnerability Research reported that the properties set on an object
passed to <code>showModalDialog</code> were readable by the document
contained in the dialog, even when the document was from a different
domain.  This is a violation of the same-origin policy and could
result in a website running untrusted JavaScript if it assumed
the <code>dialogArguments</code> could not be initialized by another
site.</p>

<p>An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative, also independently reported this issue to Mozilla.</p>
