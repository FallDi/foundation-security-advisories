title: Arbitrary code execution with Firebug XMLHttpRequestSpy
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported
that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was exposing
an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability.  When the
XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects.  This could result in an attacker running arbitrary
JavaScript on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to
have Firebug installed, so the overall severity of the issue was
determined to be High.</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6</p>
