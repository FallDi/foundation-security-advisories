title: Integer overflow vulnerability in NewIdArray
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>regenrecht</strong> reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that JavaScript arrays were
vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The report
demonstrated that an array could be constructed containing a very
large number of items such that when memory was allocated to store the
array items, the integer value used to calculate the buffer size would
overflow resulting in too small a buffer being allocated. Subsequent
use of the array object could then result in data being written past
the end of the buffer and causing memory corruption.</p>
