title: Freed object reuse across plugin instances

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Microsoft Vulnerability Research</strong> reported that two
plugin instances could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a
reference to an object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold
that reference after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is
destroyed.  In these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer
to freed memory which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to
execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer.</p>
