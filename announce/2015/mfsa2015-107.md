title: Out-of-bounds read during 2D canvas display on Linux 16-bit color depth systems
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Francisco Alonso</strong> of the NowSecure Research Team
used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an out-of-bounds read issue during 2D canvas
rendering. This was due to an issue in the cairo graphics library when surfaces are
created with 32-bit color depth but displayed on a 16-bit color depth system, which is
unsupported. This allows an attacker to read an amount of random memory following the heap
for the 16-bit surface leading to information disclosure.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue is specific to Linux in certain configurations and does not
affect Windows or OS X systems.
