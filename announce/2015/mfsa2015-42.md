title: Windows can retain access to privileged content on navigation to unprivileged pages
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Bobby Holley</strong> reported that windows created
to hold privileged UI content retained access to privileged internal methods if
later navigated to unprivileged content. If a separate flaw was found that
allowed for web content to reference these privileged windows, an attacker could
use this reference to navigate them to their own content allowing for an
escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. On its own, this flaw does
not allow for privilege escalation by web content.
