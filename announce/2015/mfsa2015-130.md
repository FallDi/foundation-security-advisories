title: JavaScript garbage collection crash with Java applet
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Vytautas Staraitis</strong> reported an issue with the
interaction of Java applets and JavaScript. The Java plugin can deallocate a JavaScript
wrapper when it is still in use, which leads to a JavaScript garbage collection crash.
This crash is potentially exploitable.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects systems where Java is installed and enabled as a
browser plugin. Other systems are unaffected.</p>
