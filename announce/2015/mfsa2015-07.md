title: Gecko Media Plugin sandbox escape
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Nils</strong> discovered a mechanism to break out
of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/GeckoMediaPlugins">Gecko Media
Plugin</a> (GMP) sandbox on Windows systems. The GMP sandbox is currently only
used to host h.264 video playback using the OpenH264 plugin but is being
developed to host other other media plugins. This bug would allow an attacker to
escape or bypass the GMP sandbox if another exploitable bug is found in a GMP
media plugin which allowed them to compromise the GMP process.
</p>

<p class="note">This bugs only affects Windows systems. OS X and Linux systems
are not affected by it.</p>
