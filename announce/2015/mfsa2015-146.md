title: Integer overflow in MP4 playback in 64-bit versions
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ronald Crane</strong> reported a vulnerability found
through code inspection. This issue is an integer overflow while processing an MP4 format
video file when an a erroneously-small buffer is allocated and then overrun, resulting in
a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects 64-bit versions with 32-bit versions being
unaffected.</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
