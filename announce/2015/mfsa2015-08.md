title: Delegated OCSP responder certificates failure with id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Brian Smith</strong> reported that delegated Online Certificate
Status Protocol (OCSP) responder certificates fail to recognize the
<code>id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck</code> extension. If this extension is present in a
delegated OCSP response signing certificate, it will be discarded if it is
signed by such a certificate. This could result in a user connecting to a site
with a revoked certificate.
