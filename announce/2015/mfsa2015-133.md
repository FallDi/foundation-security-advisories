title: NSS and NSPR memory corruption issues
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla engineers <strong>Tyson Smith</strong> and <strong>David Keeler</strong>
reported a use-after-poison and buffer overflow in the ASN.1 decoder in Network Security
Services (NSS). These issues were in octet string parsing and were found through fuzzing
and code inspection. If these issues were exploited, they would lead to a potentially
exploitable crash. These issues were fixed in NSS version 3.19.2.1 and 3.19.4, shipped in
Firefox and Firefox ESR, respectively, as well as NSS 3.20.1.</p>

<p>Google security engineer <strong>Ryan Sleevi</strong> reported an integer overflow in
the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) due to a lack of checks during memory allocation.
This leads to a potentially exploitable crash. This issue is fixed in NSPR 4.10.10. The NSPR library is a required component of NSS.
