title: ECDSA signature validation fails to handle some signatures correctly
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Watson Ladd</strong> reported that the
implementation of Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) multiplication for
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature validation in
Network Security Services (NSS) did not handle exceptional cases correctly. This
could potentially allow for signature forgery. This issue was fixed in NSS
version 3.19.1.
