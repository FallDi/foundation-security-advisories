title: Caja Compiler JavaScript sandbox bypass
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Jan de Mooij</strong> reported an issue that
affects web content that relies on the <a
href="https://developers.google.com/caja/">Caja Compiler</a> for
protection, or other similar sandboxing libraries. He found that some JavaScript
objects marked as non-extensible within Caja and Secure EcmaScript could be made
extensible again, bypassing the Caja sandboxing security measures, when the
JavaScript code should not be allowed to run.
</p>

<p class="note">Firefox users are not directly impacted by this issue. This
issue affects code running in Caja within loaded web content that should run
within its protections.
