title: HTML injection in homescreen app bypassing DOM sanitizer
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla fixed a bug in the l10n localization of the default homescreen
app of Firefox OS reported by security researcher <strong>Muneaki
Nishimura</strong>. Exploiting this issue requires tricking the user into
bookmarking a specially crafted web page via the 'Add to home screen'
functionality. As a result, an <code>iframe</code> controlled by the
attacker would be executed with homescreen privileges, potentially
leading to further system compromise.</p>
