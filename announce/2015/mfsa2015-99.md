title: Site attribute spoofing on Android by pasting URL with unknown scheme
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> reported that on Firefox for
Android, when a URL is pasted with an unknown protocol, such as <code>secure:</code> or
<code>httpz:</code>, the pasted URL is shown in the addressbar but no navigation occurs.
Other addressbar attributes present before this pasted URL is entered will continue to be
rendered. This could lead to potential spoofing by a malicious site. 
 </p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects Firefox for Android and does not affect Firefox on
OS X, Linux, or Windows operating systems.</p>
