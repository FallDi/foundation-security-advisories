title: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla Developer <strong>Jed Davis</strong> and Mozilla security engineer
<strong>Christoph Diehl</strong> reported that Mozilla had inherited a
Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability when IPC was introduced into
Mozilla products through third-party code. This could allow for privilege
escalation through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the
listener process. 
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects systems running Windows, leaving Linux
and OS X unaffected.</p>
