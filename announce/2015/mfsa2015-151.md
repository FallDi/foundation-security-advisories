title: Lockscreen delay bypass in Firefox OS
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Frederik Braun</strong> of Mozilla discovered a bug in the
lockscreen state logic that allows an attacker to bypass the lockscreen
delay. The delay was introduced to make it harder to brute-force the
passcode lock of a Firefox OS device when an attacker has gained physical
access. A successful attack would render that tar-pitting mechanism
ineffective.</p>
