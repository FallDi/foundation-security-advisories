title: Trailing whitespace in IP address hostnames can bypass same-origin policy
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Michał Bentkowski</strong> reported that adding white-space
characters to hostnames that are IP addresses can bypass same-origin policy. This flaw was
caused by trailing whitespaces being evaluated differently when parsing IP addresses
instead of alphanumeric hostnames. This could lead to a cross-site script (XSS) attack.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
