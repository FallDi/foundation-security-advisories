Android that it is possible to create a cross-site script (XSS) attack through the use of
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html">Android
intents</a> and fallback navigation. This issue is caused by improper sterilization of
opened addresses sent to Firefox through intents.
