title: Cookie injection through Proxy Authenticate responses
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Xiaofeng Zheng</strong> of the Blue Lotus Team at
Tsinghua University reported reported that a Web Proxy returning a 407 Proxy
Authentication response with a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header could inject
cookies into the originally requested domain. This could be used for
session-fixation attacks. This attack only allows cookies to be written but does
not allow them to be read. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like
contexts.</p>
