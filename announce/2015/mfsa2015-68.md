title: OS X crash reports may contain entered key press information
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>David Parks</strong> discovered while reviewing
Firefox crash reports that personal data can sometimes be contained in reports
from OS X systems. This is because these OS X crash reports will contain the
native key that triggered the crash and this can sometimes contain key press
information that was being entered when the crash occurred.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue does not affect Linux or Windows installations of
Firefox.</p>
