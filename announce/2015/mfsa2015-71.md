title: NSS incorrectly permits skipping of ServerKeyExchange
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Karthikeyan Bhargavan</strong> reported an issue
in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA
exchange where the server does not send its <code>ServerKeyExchange</code>
message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead, the NSS client will take the
EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has
some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation, the browser
thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange, but has been silently downgraded to a
non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result, if <code>False
Start</code> is enabled, the browser will start sending data encrypted under
these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version
3.19.1.</p>
