title: Privilege escalation vulnerabilities in WebExtension APIs
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Kris Maglione</strong> reported a mechanism where
WebExtension APIs could be used to escalate privilege. This could allow arbitrary web
content to execute code with the privileges of a particular WebExtension when using these
API calls. Depending on the privileges of the extension used, this could result in
personal information theft and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, including theft of browser cookies. This is mitigated by the requirement to have a WebExtension installed that is vulnerable to this issue.
