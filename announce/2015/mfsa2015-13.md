title: Appended period to hostnames can bypass HPKP and HSTS protections
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Muneaki Nishimura</strong> reported that when
certificate pinning is set to "strict" mode, a period ('.') appended to a
hostname in the address of a site allowed the bypass key pinning (HPKP) and HTTP
Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Sites with a period appended were treated as
having a different origin than sites without the period. If an attacker had a
security certificate for a domain with the added period, this would allow for a
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on users.
