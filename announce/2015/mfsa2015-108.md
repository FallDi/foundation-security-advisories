title: Scripted proxies can access inner window
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>André Bargull</strong> reported that when a web page
creates a scripted proxy for the window with a handler defined a certain way, a reference
to the inner window will be passed, rather than that of the outer window in violation of
the specification.
