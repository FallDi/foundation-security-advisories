title: UMS (USB) mounting after reboot even without unlocking
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Clement Lefevre</strong> reported a bug in USB Mass Storage handling of Firefox OS that
would allow unauthorized access to device data through the USB interface. The logic error would
under certain circumstances expose USB media volumes to USB hosts while the device is locked
with a pass code, for example after a reboot or after certain screen saver state changes.</p>
