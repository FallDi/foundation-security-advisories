title: Key pinning is ignored when overridable errors are encountered
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security engineer <strong>David Keeler</strong> reported that when an
overridable error is encountered, such as those for expired certificates or a
host name does not match a certificate, pinning checks can be be skipped. This
would allow for a user to override a pinned certificate when they should not be
able to do so. This issue does not allow for third parties to cause a
certificate to be overridden and the user would still have to manually do so.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
