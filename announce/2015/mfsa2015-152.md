title: Lockscreen passcode bypass due to race condition
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Shally Li</strong> was first to report a race condition
in the lockscreen of Firefox OS that can be used to bypass the passcode
lock of a Firefox OS device. Under certain circumstances on a locked
device, the user will be dropped directly to the homescreen instead of
being presented with the passcode input dialog.</p>
