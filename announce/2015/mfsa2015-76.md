title: Wifi direct system messages don't require a permission
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Paul Theriault</strong> of Mozilla discovered a privacy issue with a WiFi-related system
message that wasn't properly restricted to apps with the "wifi-manage" permission. As a result,
even unprivileged apps could have received those messages, allowing them to extract limited
information from a vulnerable Firefox OS device under certain rare conditions.</p>
