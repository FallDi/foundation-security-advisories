title: Cursor clickjacking with flash and images
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> reported a mechanism that
made cursor invisible through flash content and then replaced it through the
layering of HTML content. This flaw can be in used in combination with an image
of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to clickjacking during
subsequent interactions with HTML content.
</p>

<p class="note">This flaw only affects OS X systems. Windows and Linux
installations are unaffected.
