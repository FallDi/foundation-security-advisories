title: Privilege escalation in PDF.js
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Jonas Jenwald</strong> reported broken behavior in Mozilla's <code>PDF.js</code> PDF file viewer which led to the discovery that internal Workers were incorrectly executed with high privilege. If this flaw were combined with a separate vulnerability allowing for same-origin policy violation, it could be used to run arbitrary code.
