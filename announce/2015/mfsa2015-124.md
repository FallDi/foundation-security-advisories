title: Android intents can be used on Firefox for Android to open privileged files
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Muneaki Nishimura</strong> reported that on Firefox for
Android, a search engine can be registered and used to launch Firefox through an <a
href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html">Android
intent</a>. When Firefox for Android is launched, the URL can executed with Firefox's
system privileges if the crash reporter is used. This allows for the reading of local log
files within Firefox, potentially leaking private information, and the loading of local
HTML files through <code>file:</code> URIs.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects Firefox for Android on Android 4.4 or earlier. It
does not affect more recent versions of Android except for causing a non-exploitable
crash. Firefox on other operating systems is not affected.</p>
