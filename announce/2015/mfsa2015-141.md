title: Hash in data URI is incorrectly parsed
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Abdulrahman Alqabandi</strong> reported that when a
<code>data:</code> URI is parsed, the hash ('#') symbol is incorrectly handled, allowing
for spoofing attacks. This issue could result in the wrong URI being displayed as a
location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one
loaded.
