title: Same-origin policy violation using performance.getEntries and history navigation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>cgvwzq</strong> reported that it is possible to read
cross-origin URLs following a redirect if <code>performance.getEntries()</code> is used
along with an iframe to host a page. Navigating back in history through script, content is
pulled from the browser cache for the redirected location instead of going to the original
location. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft. 
</p>

<p class="note">This issue affects other browsers as well and is not limited to Mozilla products.</p>
