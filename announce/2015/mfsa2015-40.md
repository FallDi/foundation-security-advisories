title: Same-origin bypass through anchor navigation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Olli Pettay</strong> reported that while
investigating <a
href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2015-28/">Mozilla
Foundation Security Advisory 2015-28</a>, he and Mozilla developer <strong>Boris
Zbarsky</strong> found an alternate way to trigger a similar vulnerability. The
previously reported flaw used an issue with SVG content navigation to bypass
same-origin policy protections to run scripts in a privileged context. This
newer variant found that the same flaw could be used during anchor navigation of
a page, allowing bypassing of same-origin policy protections. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
