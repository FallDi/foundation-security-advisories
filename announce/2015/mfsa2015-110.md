title: Dragging and dropping images exposes final URL after redirects
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mario Gomes</strong> reported that when a previously
loaded image on a page is drag and dropped into content after a redirect, the redirected
URL is available to scripts. This is a violation of the  <a
href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch specification's</a> defined behavior for
"Atomic HTTP redirect handling" which states that redirected URLs are not exposed to any
APIs. This can allow for information leakage. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
