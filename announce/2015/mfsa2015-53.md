title: Use-after-free due to Media Decoder Thread creation during shutdown
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Tyson Smith</strong> and <strong>Jesse Schwartzentruber</strong> reported a use-after-free
during the shutdown process. This was caused by a race condition when media
decoder threads are created during the shutdown process in some circumstances.
This leads to a potentially exploitable crash when triggered.
