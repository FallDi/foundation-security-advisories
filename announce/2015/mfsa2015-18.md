title: Double-free when using non-default memory allocators with a zero-length XHR
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Abhishek Arya</strong> (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team and Mozilla security developer <strong>Gary Kwong</strong>
used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a double-free error when sending a
zero-length XmlHttpRequest (XHR). This was due to errors in memory allocation
when using different memory allocator libraries than <code>jemalloc</code> used
by Mozilla builds. When those other memory allocators are used to for build
compilation, this could cause a potentially exploitable crash during some XHR
actions.
</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability does not happen in Firefox as built by
Mozilla, but can occur when Firefox is built using a memory allocator that
follows older pre-standard behaviors.
