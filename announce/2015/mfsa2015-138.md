title: Use-after-free in WebRTC when datachannel is used after being destroyed
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Looben Yang</strong> reported a use-after-free error in
WebRTC that occurs due to timing issues in WebRTC when closing channels. WebRTC may still
believe is has a datachannel open after another WebRTC function has closed it. This
results in attempts to use the now destroyed datachannel, leading to a potentially
exploitable crash.
