title: Out-of-bounds read and write while rendering SVG content
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Abhishek Arya</strong> (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to report an out-of-bounds
read and an out-of-bounds write when rendering an improperly formatted SVG
graphic. This could potentially allow the attacker to read uninitialized memory.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
