title: Certain escaped characters in host of Location-header are being treated as non-escaped
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Frans Rosén</strong> reported that URLs with certain
escaped characters in hostnames are parsed incorrectly. This leads to parsing being
abandoned when an effected escaped character is encountered followed by a navigation to
the previously parsed version of the URL. When combined with a site allowing for
navigation redirection that allows for escaped characters, this could lead to potential
extraction of site specific tokens.
