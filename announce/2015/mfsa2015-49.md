title: Referrer policy ignored when links opened by middle-click and context menu
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Alex Verstak</strong> reported that &lt;meta
name="referrer"&gt; is ignored when a link is opened through the
context menu or a middle-click by mouse. This means that, in some situations,
the referrer policy is ignored when opening links in new tabs and may cause
some pages to open without an HTTP Referer header being set according to
the author's intended policy.
