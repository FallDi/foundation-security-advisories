title: CORS preflight is bypassed when non-standard Content-Type headers are received
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Shinto K Anto</strong> reported an issue with cross-origin
resource sharing (CORS) "preflight" requests when receiving certain
<code>Content-Type</code> headers. This is due to an error in implementation resulting in
trying to process multiple media types when they are returned in the
<code>Content-Type</code> headers from a server. This is disallowed in the CORS <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">specification</a> and results in a simple instead of a
"preflight" request, leading to potential same-origin policy violation.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
