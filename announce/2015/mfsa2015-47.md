title: Buffer overflow parsing H.264 video with Linux Gstreamer
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Aki Helin</strong> used the Address Sanitizer
tool to find a buffer overflow during video playback on Linux systems. This was
due to a problem in older versions of the Gstreamer plugin during the parsing of
H.264 formatted video. This issue could be used to induce a possibly exploitable
crash.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue does not affect the current 1.0 version of Gstreamer
and does not affect Windows or OS X systems.
