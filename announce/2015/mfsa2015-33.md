title: resource:// documents can load privileged pages
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> reported, through HP
Zero Day Initiative's Pwn2Own contest, that documents loaded though a
<code>resource:</code> URL, such as Mozilla's <code>PDF.js</code> PDF file
viewer, were able to subsequently load privileged chrome pages. The privilege
restrictions on <code>resource:</code> URLs was handled incorrectly and these
restrictions could be bypassed if this flaw was combined with a separate
vulnerability allowing for same-origin policy violation, it could be used to run
arbitrary code.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
