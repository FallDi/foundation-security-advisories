title: Arbitrary file overwriting through Mozilla Maintenance Service with hard links
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>James Forshaw</strong>, security researcher with
Google Project Zero, reported that the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows
can be made to write its log file in a restricted location with an arbitrary
file name through the use of a hard link by means of a race condition. This can
allow the log file to overwrite another named file that a user would not have
the privileges to change. If the overwritten file is used as source input or
script by a program with elevated privileges, it could allow for an escalation
of privilege attack. This requires local file system access and the ability to
execute local programs to be exploitable.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects Windows systems. OS X and Linux
operating systems are unaffected.</p>
