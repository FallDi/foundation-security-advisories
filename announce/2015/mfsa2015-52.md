title: Sensitive URL encoded information written to Android logcat
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Muneaki Nishimura</strong> reported that Firefox
for Android would write potentially sensitive data to the Android
<code>logcat</code> that was encoded as part of logged URL strings. On Android
4.0 or earlier systems, <code>logcat</code> data is available to any application
having <code>READ_LOGS</code> permission, leading to potential privacy
violations.
</p>

<p class="note">This does not affect non-Android versions of Firefox and is
mitigated in versions of Android higher than 4.0.</p>
