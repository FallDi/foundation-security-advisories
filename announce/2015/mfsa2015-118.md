title: CSP bypass due to permissive Reader mode whitelist
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mario Heiderich</strong> reported an issue where the
security protections of Reader mode in Firefox can be bypassed, allowing scripts to be
run. Mozilla developer <strong>Frederik Braun</strong> independently discovered and
reported this same issue as well. This issue happens even though Reader View explicitly
disables script for rendered pages through a whitelist of allowed HTML content. Mario
discovered that the whitelist was too permissive and a malicious site could manipulate
content to bypass CSP protections, allowing for possible cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.
