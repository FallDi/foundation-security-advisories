title: Disabling scripts in Add-on SDK panels has no effect
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add-on authors <strong>Jason Hamilton</strong> and <strong>Peter Arremann</strong> with
AMO editor <strong>Sylvain Giroux</strong> reported a vulnerability when a
<code>panel</code> is created using the Add-on SDK in a browser extension. Defining a
panel with <code>script: false</code> is supposed to disable script execution but it was
found that inline script would still execute. This flaw allows for the potential execution
of script content in an extension when it was been explicitly disallowed.</p>

<p>The potential impact of this flaw would depend on whether the add-on was relying on
<code>script: false</code> as a security mechanism and from location the panel content was
loaded. No add-ons served from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org</a>
are vulnerable to this flaw but add-ons installed from third party sites may be.</p>
