title: TLS TURN and STUN connections silently fail to simple TCP connections
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Alexander Kolesnik</strong> reported while the
Mozilla platform does not yet support TLS connections to TURN and STUN servers,
the WebRTC implementation would accept <code>turns:</code> and
<code>stuns:</code> URIs and then attempt plaintext connections to the servers
when these were used. This can lead to disclosure of credentials through a
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack as the connection is not encrypted.
