title: Information disclosure via the High Resolution Time API
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Yossef Oren, Vasileios P. Kemerlis, Simha Sethumadhavan,
Angelos D. Keromytis</strong> of Columbia University's Network Security Lab reported a
method of using the High Resolution Time API for side channel attacks. This attack uses
JavaScript loaded through a hostile web page to track access to the last-level
cache over a period of time as a user engages in other browser activity. This attack takes
advantage of the <code>performance.now()</code> API's use of single nanosecond resolution
for timing. </p>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Amit Klein</strong> independently reported use of the
<code>performance.now()</code> API on Windows systems to extract the Windows counter
frequency as an avenue for side channel attacks. 
</p>

<p>Both of these flaws allow for the disclosure of private information, user
fingerprinting, and data leakage. They have been addressed by reducing the resolution of
the <code>performance.now()</code> API to 5 microseconds to remove the precision in
resolution available to attackers.
</p>

<p class="note">The Windows counter frequency issue does not affect Linux or OS X systems.
