title: Upper bound check bypass due to signed compare in SharedBufferManagerParent::RecvAllocateGrallocBuffer
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla intern <strong>Julian Hector</strong> discovered a regression in the graphics buffer management
of Firefox OS's graphics layer that would lead to graphics memory corruption by providing negative size
parameters. JavaScript can not access the graphics layer in a way required to trigger this vulnerability,
but it could be potentially used in a staged attack.</p>
