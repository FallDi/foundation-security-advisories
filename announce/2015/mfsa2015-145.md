title: Underflow through code inspection
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ronald Crane</strong> reported an underflow found through
code inspection. This does not all have a clear mechanism to be exploited through web
content but could be vulnerable if a means can be found to trigger it.</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
