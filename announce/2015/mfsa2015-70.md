title: NSS accepts export-length DHE keys with regular DHE cipher suites
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Matthew Green</strong> reported a Diffieâ€“Hellman
(DHE) key processing issue in Network Security Services (NSS) where a
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can force a server to downgrade TLS
connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography by modifying client
requests to include only export-grade cipher suites. The resulting
weak key can then be leveraged to impersonate the server. This attack
is detailed in the "<a
href="https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy.pdf">Imperfect Forward
Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice</a>" paper and is known as the
&quot;Logjam Attack.&quot;</p>

<p>This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1 by limiting the lower strength of
supported DHE keys to use 1023 bit primes.
