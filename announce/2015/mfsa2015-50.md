title: Out-of-bounds read and write in asm.js validation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Dougall Johnson</strong> reported an
out-of-bounds read and write in <code>asm.js</code> during JavaScript validation
due to an error in how heap lengths are defined. This results in a potentially
exploitable crash and could allow for the reading of random memory which may
contain sensitive data.
