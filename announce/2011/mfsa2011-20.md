title: Use-after-free vulnerability when viewing XUL document with script disabled

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Martin Barbella</strong> reported that
under certain conditions, viewing a XUL document while JavaScript was
disabled caused deleted memory to be accessed.  This flaw could
potentially be used by an attacker to crash a victim's browser and run
arbitrary code on their computer.</p>

<p class="note">XUL document support was disabled by default in
Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1 and users of those versions are not generally
at risk. It is possible for add-ons to re-enable the feature for specific
sites (for example, to support a legacy intranet XUL application) which would
have introduced this vulnerability while browsing those sites.</p>
