title: Code installation through holding down <kbd>Enter</kbd>
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> reported that if you could convince
a user to hold down the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key--as part of a game or test,
perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a download dialog where the held
key would then activate the default Open action. For some file types this
would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would provide an
avenue for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in applications not
normally exposed to potentially hostile internet content.
</p>

<p>Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin installation
using the <code>PLUGINSPAGE</code> attribute. It was possible to create
an internal error that suppressed a confirmation dialog, such that holding
enter would lead to the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant
did not affect Firefox 3.6)
