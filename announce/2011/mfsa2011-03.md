title: Use-after-free error in JSON.stringify
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>regenrecht</strong> reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a method used
by <code>JSON.stringify</code> contained a use-after-free error in
which a currently in-use pointer was freed and subsequently
dereferenced.  This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an
attacker was able to store malicious code in the freed section of
memory.</p>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Igor Bukanov</strong> also independently
discovered and reported this issue two weeks after the initial
report was received.</p>
