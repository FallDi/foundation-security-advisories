title: Potential XSS against sites using Shift-JIS
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Yosuke Hasegawa</strong> reported that the Mozilla browser engine
mishandled invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. When encountering an
invalid pair Mozilla would turn the entire two-byte sequence into a single
unknown character rather than an unknown character followed by a valid
single-byte character. On some sites attackers may have been able to
end their input with the first byte of a two byte sequence; when that
input was later put into a page context it might cause the following
delimiter (such as a double-quote) to be consumed, breaking the format
of the page.  Depending on the page this could potentially be used to
steal data or inject script into the page.</p>
