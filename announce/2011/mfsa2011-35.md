title: Additional protection against fraudulent DigiNotar certificates

<p><span class="label">Description:</span> As more information has
come to light about the attack on the
DigiNotar Certificate Authority we have improved the protections
added in <a href="/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-34.html">MFSA 2011-34</a>.
The main change is to add explicit distrust to the DigiNotar root
certificate and several intermediates. Removing the root as in our
previous fix meant the certificates could be considered valid if
cross-signed by another Certificate Authority. Importantly this
list of distrusted certificates  includes
the "PKIOverheid" (PKIGovernment) intermediates under DigiNotar's
control that did not chain to DigiNotar's root and were not
previously blocked.</p>
