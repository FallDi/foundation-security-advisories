title: Multiple WebGL crashes
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>Christoph Diehl</strong> reported two
crashes in WebGL code. One crash was the result of an out-of-bounds
read and could be used to read data from other processes who had
stored data in the GPU. The severity of this issue was determined to
be high. The second crash was the result of an invalid write and could
be used to execute arbitrary code. The severity of this issue was
determined to be critical.</p>

<p class="note">The WebGL functionality was introduced in the browser engine used
by Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1; the vulnerability does not affect earlier versions.</p>
