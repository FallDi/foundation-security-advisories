title: Stealing of cross-domain images using WebGL textures
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security research firm <strong>Context IS</strong> discovered that
an image from a different domain could be loaded into a WebGL texture,
and then each pixel could be rendered into a canvas element with a
shader program, creating an approximation of the image in a form that
was readable by the creator of the WebGL texture.  This could be used
to steal image data from a different site and is considered a
violation of the same-origin policy.</p>

<p class="note">The WebGL functionality was introduced in the browser engine used
by Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1; the vulnerability does not affect earlier versions.</p>
