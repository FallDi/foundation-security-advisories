title: Integer overflow and arbitrary code execution in Array.reduceRight()
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Chris Rohlf</strong> and <strong>Yan
Ivnitskiy</strong> of Matasano Security reported that when a
JavaScript <code>Array</code> object had its length set to an
extremely large value, the iteration of array elements that occurs
when its <code>reduceRight</code> method was subsequently called could
result in the execution of attacker controlled memory due to an
invalid index value being used to access element properties.</p>
