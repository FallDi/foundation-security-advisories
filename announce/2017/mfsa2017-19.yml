    title: Memory protection bypass through WindowsDllDetourPatcher
    impact: high
    reporter: Stephen Fewer
    description: |
      The destructor function for the <code>WindowsDllDetourPatcher</code> class can be re-purposed by malicious code in concert with another vulnerability to write arbitrary data to an attacker controlled location in memory. This can be used to bypass existing memory protections in this situation. <br>*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 55 and Firefox ESR 52.3
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Masayuki Nakano, Gary Kwong, Ronald Crane, Andrew McCreight, Tyson Smith, Bevis Tseng, Christian Holler, Bryce Van Dyk, Dragana Damjanovic, Kartikaya Gupta, Philipp, Tristan Bourvon, and Andi-Bogdan Postelnicu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
