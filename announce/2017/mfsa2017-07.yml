    impact: critical
    reporter: Ivan Fratric of Google Project Zero

  CVE-2017-5407:
    title: Pixel and history stealing via floating-point timing side channel with SVG filters
    impact: high
    reporter: David Kohlbrenner
    description: |
      Using SVG filters that don't use the fixed point math implementation on a target iframe, a malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user. This can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 45.8
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jon Coppeard, Randell Jesup, Andr√© Bargull, Kan-Ru Chen, and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
