    title: Web worker in Private Browsing mode can write IndexedDB data
    impact: high
    reporter: Konark
    description: |
      When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in Private Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions because it is not cleared when exiting.
