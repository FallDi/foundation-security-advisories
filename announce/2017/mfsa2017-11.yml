    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 53, Firefox ESR 45.9, and Firefox ESR 52.1
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
