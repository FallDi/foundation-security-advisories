  CVE-2017-7824:
    title: Buffer overflow when drawing and validating elements with ANGLE
    impact: high
    reporter: Omair, Andre Weissflog

  CVE-2017-7805:
    title: Use-after-free in TLS 1.2 generating handshake hashes
    impact: high
    reporter: Martin Thomson
    description: |
      During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2017-7814:
    title: Blob and data URLs bypass phishing and malware protection warnings
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Fran√ßois Marier
    description: |
      File downloads encoded with <code>blob:</code> and <code>data:</code> URL elements bypassed normal file download checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection feature and its block lists of suspicious sites and files. This would allow malicious sites to lure users into downloading executables that would otherwise be detected as suspicious.

  CVE-2017-7825:
    title: OS X fonts render some Tibetan and Arabic unicode characters as spaces
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Khalil Zhani 
    description: |
      Several fonts on OS X display some Tibetan and Arabic characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks. <br>*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

  CVE-2017-7823:
    title: CSP sandbox directive did not create a unique origin
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
       The content security policy (CSP) <code>sandbox</code> directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the <code>allow-same-origin</code> keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content.

  CVE-2017-7810:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 56 and Firefox ESR 52.4
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Tom Ritter, Tyson Smith, and Sebastian Hengst reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 55 and Firefox ESR 52.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
