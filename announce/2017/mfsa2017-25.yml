      Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, David Keeler, Jon Coppeard, Julien Cristau, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Philipp, Nicholas Nethercote, Oriol Brufau, Andr√© Bargull, Bob Clary, Jet Villegas, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Gary Kwong, and Ryan VanderMeulen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56 and Firefox ESR 52.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
