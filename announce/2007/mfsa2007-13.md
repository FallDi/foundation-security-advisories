title: Persistent Autocomplete Denial of Service
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Marcel</strong> reported that a malicious web page could
perform a denial of service attack against the form autocomplete
feature that would persist from session to session until the malicious
form data was deleted. Filling a text field with millions of
characters and submitting the form will cause the victim's browser
to hang for up to several minutes while the form data is read,
and this will happen the first time autocomplete is triggered
after every browser restart.</p>

<p>No harm is done to the user's computer, but the frustration
caused by the hang could prevent use of Firefox if users don't
know how to clear the bad state.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Once affected by the Denial-of-Service condition normalcy can be
restored by deleting stored form data through the "Clear Private Data"
item on the Tools menu. This should be done immediately after a restart
and before entering any keystrokes into a form field to avoid triggering
the hang before the data can be cleared.</p>

<p>The attack can be prevented on older versions of Firefox by unchecking
"Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar" on the Privacy tab
of the Options dialog.</p>
