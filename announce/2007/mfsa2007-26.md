title: Privilege escalation through chrome-loaded about:blank windows
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported that a flaw was
introduced by the fix for <a href="mfsa2007-20.html">MFSA 2007-20</a> that
could enable privilege escalation attacks against addons that create
"about:blank" windows and populate them in certain ways (including
implicit "about:blank" document creation through data: or javascript:
URLs in a new window).</p>


<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Any workaround would depend on the addon in question. One addon known to be
affected was the Web Developer Toolbar, which was safe in its default
configuration but potentially vulnerable to malicious web content if
informational windows were opened as separate windows instead of tabs.
The workaround for this, then, is to switch back to the default setting.</p>

<p>Other affected addons might not have a workaround other than to upgrade
to a fixed version of Firefox.</p>
