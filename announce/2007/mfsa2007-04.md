title: Spoofing using custom cursor and CSS3 hotspot
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name
and security indicators--could be spoofed by using a large, mostly
transparent, custom cursor and adjusting the CSS3 hotspot property
so that the visible part of the cursor floated outside the browser
content area.</p>

<p>This feature was introduced in Firefox 1.5 and does not affect products
based on Mozilla 1.7 or earlier such as Firefox 1.0</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Any such spoofing can be made less effective by customizing the appearance
of your browser. Right-click on an empty toolbar area and select
"Customize..." to move, add, or delete toolbar buttons and other elements.</p>
