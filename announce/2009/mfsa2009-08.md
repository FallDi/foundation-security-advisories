title: Mozilla Firefox XUL Linked Clones Double Free Vulnerability
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An anonymous researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
program, reported a vulnerability in Mozilla's garbage collection
process.  The vulnerability was caused by improper memory management
of a set of cloned XUL DOM elements which were linked as a parent and
child.  After reloading the browser on a page with such linked
elements, the browser would crash when attempting to access an object
which was already destroyed.  An attacker could use this crash to run
arbitrary code on the victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2,
Thunderbird 2, or released versions of SeaMonkey.
