title: Heap buffer overflow in string to number conversion
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Alin Rad Pop</strong> of Secunia
Research reported a heap-based buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to
floating point number conversion routines.  Using this vulnerability
an attacker could craft some malicious JavaScript code containing a
very long string to be converted to a floating point number which
would result in improper memory allocation and the execution of an
arbitrary memory location.  This vulnerability could thus be leveraged
by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The underlying flaw in the <code>dtoa</code> routines used
by Mozilla appears to be essentially the same as that reported against the
libc <code>gdtoa</code> routine by <strong>Maksymilian Arciemowicz</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.</p>
