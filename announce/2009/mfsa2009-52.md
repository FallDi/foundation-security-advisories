title: Form history vulnerable to stealing

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Paul Stone</strong> reported that a
user's form history, both from web content as well as the smart
location bar, was vulnerable to theft.  A malicious web page could
synthesize events such as mouse focus and key presses on behalf of the
victim and trick the browser into auto-filling the form fields with
history entries and then reading the entries.</p>
