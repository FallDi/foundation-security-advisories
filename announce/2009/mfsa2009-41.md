title: Corrupt JIT state after deep return from native function
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Firefox user <strong>zbyte</strong> reported a crash that we determined
could result in an exploitable memory corruption problem. In certain cases
after a return from a native function, such as <code>escape()</code>, the
Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler could get into a corrupt state. This could be
exploited by an attacker to run arbitrary code such as installing malware.
</p>
<p>We would like to thank community members <strong>Lucas
Kruijswijk</strong> and <strong>Nochum Sossonko</strong> for isolating
the problematic script from the original crashing site.
</p>
<p>This vulnerability does not affect earlier versions of Firefox which
do not support the JIT feature.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>
<p>Users of Firefox 3.5 can avoid this vulnerability by disabling the
Just-in-Time compiler as described in the 
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2009/07/14/critical-javascript-vulnerability-in-firefox-35/">
Mozilla Security Blog</a>. That workaround is not necessary in
Firefox 3.5.1 and can be reverted.
