title: Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.0.11)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to
prepare memory for exploitation through some means other than
JavaScript such as large images.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>

trigger double frame construction which could lead to memory
corruption.</p>
