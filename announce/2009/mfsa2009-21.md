title: POST data sent to wrong site when saving web page with embedded frame
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Developer and Mozilla community member <strong>Paolo
Amadini</strong> reported that when saving the inner frame of a web
page as a file when the outer page has POST data associated with it,
the POST data will be incorrectly sent to the URL of the inner frame.
This could potentially result in a user's sensitive data being sent to
a site for which it was not intended.</p>
