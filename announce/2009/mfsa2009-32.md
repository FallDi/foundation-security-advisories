title: JavaScript chrome privilege escalation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported
a vulnerability which allows scripts from page content to run with
elevated privileges.  Using this vulnerability, an attacker could
cause a chrome privileged object, such as the browser sidebar or the
FeedWriter, to interact with web content in such a way that attacker
controlled code may be executed with the object's chrome
privileges.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird supports neither the sidebar nor
BrowserFeedWriter objects and is not vulnerable in its default
configuration. Thunderbird might be vulnerable if the user has installed
any add-on which adds a similarly implemented feature and then enables
JavaScript in mail messages.  This is not the default setting and we
strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail. </p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing this fix can be
installed.</p>
