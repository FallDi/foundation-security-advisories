title: 'jar: scheme ignores the content-disposition: header on the inner URI'
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Daniel Veditz</strong> reported that when
the <code>jar:</code> scheme is used to wrap a URI which serves the
content with <code>Content-Disposition: attachment</code>, the HTTP
header is ignored and the content is unpacked and displayed inline.  A
site may depend on this HTTP header to prevent potentially untrusted
content that it serves from executing within the context of the site.
An attacker could use this vulnerability to subvert sites using this
mechanism to mitigate content injection attacks.</p>

<p>This vulnerability has not been fixed on the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch,
which is used to build Firefox 2 and Thunderbird 2.  However, note
that there are several mitigating factors which prevent easy
exploitation of this issue.  In order for a website to be exploitable
it must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Allow users to upload arbitrary content</li>
  <li>Allow users to set arbitrary MIME types, or specifically serve
  .jar files as <code>application/java-archive</code>
  or <code>application/x-jar</code></li>
  <li>Serve the .jar files from a domain containing sensitive content which would otherwise be protected using <code>Content-Disposition: attachment</code></li>
</ol>
