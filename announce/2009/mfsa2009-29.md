title: Arbitrary code execution using event listeners attached to an element whose
  owner document is null
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported
that the owner document of an element can become null after garbage
collection.  In such cases, event listeners may be executed within the
wrong JavaScript context.  An attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to have a malicious event handler execute arbitrary
JavaScript with chrome privileges.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>
