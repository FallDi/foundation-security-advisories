title: Crash and remote code execution during Flash player unloading
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Attila Suszter</strong> reported that
when a page contains a Flash object which presents a slow script
dialog, and the page is navigated while the dialog is still visible to
the user, the Flash plugin is unloaded resulting in a crash due to a
call to the deleted object.  This crash could potentially be used by
an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.</p>
