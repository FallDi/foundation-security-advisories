title: Privilege escalation via chrome window.opener
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>David James</strong> reported that a
content window which is opened by a chrome window retains a reference
to the chrome window via the <code>window.opener</code> property.  Using
this reference, content in the new window can access functions 
inside the chrome window, such as <code>eval</code>, and use these
functions to run arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges. In
a stock Mozilla browser a remote attacker can not cause these application
dialogs to appear nor to automatically load the attack code that takes advantage
of this flaw in <code>window.opener</code>. There may be add-ons which open
potentially hostile web-content in this way, and combined with such an add-on the
severity of this flaw could be upgraded to Critical.
