title: Data corruption with SOCKS5 reply containing DNS name longer than 15 characters

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Andrej Andolsek</strong> reported that when Firefox
receives a reply from a SOCKS5 proxy which contains a DNS name longer
than 15 characters, the subsequent data stream in the response can
become corrupted.  There was no evidence of memory corruption,
however, and the severity of the issue was determined to be low.</p>
