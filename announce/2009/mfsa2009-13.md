title: Arbitrary code execution via XUL tree element
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Nils</strong> reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the XUL <code>tree</code>
method <code>_moveToEdgeShift</code> was in some cases triggering
garbage collection routines on objects which were still in use.  In
such cases, the browser would crash when attempting to access a
previously destroyed object and this crash could be used by an
attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability was used by the reporter to win the
2009 CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest.</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2,
Thunderbird 2, or released versions of SeaMonkey.</p>
