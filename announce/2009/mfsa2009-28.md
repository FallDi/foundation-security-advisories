title: Race condition while accessing the private data of a NPObject JS wrapper class object

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Jakob Balle</strong> and <strong>Carsten Eiram</strong> of
Secunia Research reported a race condition
in <code>NPObjWrapper_NewResolve</code> when accessing the properties
of a <code>NPObject</code>, a wrapped <code>JSObject</code>.  Balle
and Eiram demonstrated that this condition could be reached by
navigating away from a web page during the loading of a Java applet.
Under such conditions the Java object would be destroyed but later
called into resulting in a free memory read. It might be possible
for an attacker to write to the freed memory before it is reused and run
arbitrary code on the victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2 nor other
products built using the "Gecko 1.8" version of Mozilla code.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable Java until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.</p>
