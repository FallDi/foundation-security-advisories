title: Memory safety fixes in liboggplay media library
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla discovered several bugs in liboggplay which posed potential
memory safety issues.  The bugs which were fixed could potentially be
used by an attacker to crash a victim's browser and execute arbitrary
code on their computer.</p>

<p class="note">Audio and Video capabilities were added to the Mozilla browser
engine in Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0; prior releases of
these products were not affected.</p>
