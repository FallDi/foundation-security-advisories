title: Insufficient warning for PKCS11 module installation and removal
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>Jesse Ruderman</strong> reported
that when security modules were added or removed
via <code>pkcs11.addmodule</code> or <code>pkcs11.deletemodule</code>,
the resulting dialog was not sufficiently informative.  Without
sufficient warning, an attacker could entice a victim to install a
malicious PKCS11 module and affect the cryptographic integrity of the
victim's browser.</p>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Dan Kaminsky</strong> reported that
this issue had not been fixed in Firefox 3.0 and that under certain
circumstances <code>pkcs11</code> modules could be installed from a
remote location.</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 3.5 releases are not affected.</p>
