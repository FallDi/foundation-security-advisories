title: Heap/integer overflows in font glyph rendering libraries
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>oCERT security researcher <strong>Will Drewry</strong> reported a
series of heap and integer overflow vulnerabilities which
independently affected multiple font glyph rendering libraries.  On
Linux platforms libpango was susceptible to the vulnerabilities while
on OS X CoreGraphics was similarly vulnerable.  An attacker could
trigger these overflows by constructing a very large text run for the
browser to display.  Such an overflow can result in a crash which the
attacker could potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim's
computer.</p>
<p>The open-source nature of Linux meant that Mozilla was able to work
with the <code>libpango</code> maintainers to implement the correct fix
in version 1.24 of that system library which was distributed with OS
security updates. On Mac OS X Firefox works around the CoreGraphics
flaw by limiting the length of text runs passed to the system.
