title: XSS hazard using third-party stylesheets and XBL bindings
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Web developer <strong>Cefn Hoile</strong> reported that sites which
allow users to embed third-party stylesheets are vulnerable to script
injection attacks using XBL bindings.  While this behavior was
documented previously, it was determined that this particular risk was
not well-understood by some websites.  To mitigate this risk Mozilla
added a restriction that requires XBL bindings to come from the same
origin as the bound document.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>
