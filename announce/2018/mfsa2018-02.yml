    title: WebExtensions can save and execute files on local file system without user prompts
    impact: high
    reporter: Rob Wu
    description: |

    bugs:
      - url: 1390882
  CVE-2018-5106:
    title: Developer Tools can expose style editor information cross-origin through service worker
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu

    bugs:
      - url: 1408708
  CVE-2018-5107:
    title: Printing process will follow symlinks for local file access
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Alex Gaynor
    description: |
      The printing process can bypass local access protections to read files available through symlinks, bypassing local file restrictions. The printing process requires files in a specific format so arbitrary data cannot be read but it is possible that some local file information could be exposed.

  CVE-2018-5108:
    title: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Andrea Marchesini
    description: |
      A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.  
    bugs:
      - url: 1421099
  CVE-2018-5109:
    title: Audio capture prompts and starts with incorrect origin attribution
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Andreas Pehrson
    description: |
      An audio capture session can started under an incorrect origin from the site making the capture request. Users are still prompted to allow the request but the prompt can display the wrong origin, leading to user confusion about which site is making the request to capture an audio stream.
    bugs:
      - url: 1405599
  CVE-2018-5110:
    title: Cursor can be made invisible on OS X
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ron Warholic
    description: |
       If cursor visibility is toggled by script using from 'none' to an image and back through script, the cursor will be rendered temporarily invisible within Firefox. <br>*Note: This vulnerability only affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected.*
    bugs:

  CVE-2018-5111:
    title: URL spoofing in addressbar through drag and drop
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Mario Gomes
    description: |
      When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site. 
    bugs:
      - url: 1321619
  CVE-2018-5112:
    title: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.
    bugs:
      - url: 1425224
  CVE-2018-5113:
    title: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Abdulrahman Alqabandi
    description: |
      The <code>browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow</code> function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over <code>https:</code> but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.
    bugs:
      - url: 1425267
  CVE-2018-5114:
    title: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Inkognito
    description: |
       If an existing cookie is changed to be <code>HttpOnly</code> while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.
    bugs:
      - url: 1421324
  CVE-2018-5115:
    title: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jerry Decime
    description: |
      If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.
    bugs:
      - url: 1409449
  CVE-2018-5116:
    title: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ronen Zilberman
    description: |
      WebExtensions with the <code>ActiveTab</code> permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

      - url: 1396399
  CVE-2018-5117:
    title: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right 
    impact: moderate
    reporter: xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab 
    description: |
      If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.  
    bugs:
      - url: 1395508
  CVE-2018-5118:
    title: "Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:"
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Paul Theriault
    description: |
      The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through <code>file:</code> URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.
    bugs:
      - url: 1420049
  CVE-2018-5119:
    title: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers
    impact: low
    reporter: Jun Kokatsu
    description: |
      The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.
    bugs:
      - url: 1420507
  CVE-2018-5121:
    title: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar
    impact: low
    reporter: Khalil Zhani
    description: |
      Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks. <br>*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
    bugs:
      - url: 1402368
  CVE-2018-5122:
    title: Potential integer overflow in DoCrypt
    impact: low
    reporter: Casper of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
    description: |
      A potential integer overflow in the <code>DoCrypt</code> function of WebCrypto was identified. If a means was found of exploiting it, it could result in an out-of-bounds write.
