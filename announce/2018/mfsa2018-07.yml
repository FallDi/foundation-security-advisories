  CVE-2018-5131:
    title: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Ben Kelly
    description: |
      Under certain circumstances the <code>fetch()</code> API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a <code>no-store</code> or <code>no-cache</code> cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59 and Firefox ESR 52.7
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Ralph Giles, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
