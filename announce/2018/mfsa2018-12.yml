  CVE-2018-5157:
    title: Same-origin bypass of PDF Viewer to view protected PDF files
    impact: high
    reporter: Wladimir Palant 
    description: |
      Same-origin protections for the PDF viewer can be bypassed, allowing a malicious site to intercept messages meant for the viewer. This could allow the site to retrieve PDF files restricted to viewing by an authenticated user on a third-party website.

  CVE-2018-5158:
    title: Malicious PDF can inject JavaScript into PDF Viewer
    impact: high
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker.

  CVE-2018-5159:
    title: Integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in Skia
    impact: high
    reporter: Ivan Fratric
    description: |
      An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content.
    bugs:
      - url: 1441941
  CVE-2018-5168:
    title: Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the <code>baseURI</code> property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images.

  CVE-2018-5174:
    title: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jimmy
    description: |
       In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the <code>SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI</code> flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows wonâ€™t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

    impact: moderate
    reporter: Root Object
    description: |
      A buffer overflow was found during UTF8 to Unicode string conversion within JavaScript with extremely large amounts of data. This vulnerability requires the use of a malicious or vulnerable legacy extension in order to occur.

  CVE-2018-5150:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 60 and Firefox ESR 52.8
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Alex Gaynor, Ronald Crane, Julian Hector, Kannan Vijayan, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 59 and Firefox ESR 52.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
