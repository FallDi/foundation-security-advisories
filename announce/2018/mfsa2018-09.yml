    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Ralph Giles, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58, Firefox ESR 52.6, and Thunderbird 52.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
