    impact: moderate
    reporter: Wladimir Palant

  CVE-2018-5174:
    title: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Jimmy
    description: |
       In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the <code>SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI</code> flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. <br>*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 60, Firefox ESR 52.8, and Thunderbird 52.8
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Alex Gaynor, Ronald Crane, Julian Hector, Kannan Vijayan, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
