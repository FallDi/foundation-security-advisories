into the input control. A malicious site could create a page that
autocompletes some common data (such as phone number or SSN) and
potentially convince a user to arrow through the values. Script on
the page could watch the values as they are added and copy them into
a hidden field for submission to the site.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Turn off the Form Fill feature.</p>
