title: SSL "secure site" indicator spoofing
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Various schemes were reported that could cause the "secure site" lock icon
to appear and show certificate details for the wrong site. These could be
used by phishers to make their spoofs look more legitimate, particularly in
windows that hide the address bar showing the true location.</p>

<p>Mook reports that opening a spoof site that never finishes loading in a
window displaying a secure site will continue to show the security indicators
of the original site. Kohei Yoshino accomplishes the same result using
document.write() to create the spoof in the secure window.</p>

<p>Doug Turner demonstrates that faked security indicators can be turned
on for the current window contents by attempting to load content from a
non-HTTP server that supports SSL (for example, a mail server). The SSL
indicator was set based on the successful SSL handshake despite the
failure to load the requested content.</p>

<p>Similarly M. Deaudelin demonstrates that a spoofer could use a
URL that returns an HTTP 204 error to set both the SSL icon and update
the location while still showing the original content, presumably a spoof.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not browse trusted sites in the same session as untrusted sites.
Do not use or trust links from untrusted sites that "helpfully" link
to financial institutions or similar sites with high-value information.</p>
