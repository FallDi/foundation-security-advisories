title: Download dialog spoofing using Content-Disposition header
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Andreas Sandblad of Secunia Research demonstrated a method to spoof the
download dialog for saving files by supplying a Content-Disposition header
with a different extension than the extension visible in the link and
download dialog. Users could be tricked into downloading a safe-looking file
such as a JPEG image and have it actually be saved with
an executable extension.</p>

<p>Windows hides file extensions by default. If the user did not notice the
incorrect icon they might at some later time double-click on the saved
file and execute it instead of having it open in the expected media
application.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Use caution when downloading files from an untrusted site, un-hide file
extensions on windows.</p>
