title: XSLT can include stylesheets from arbitrary hosts
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>xsl:include and xsl:import can include XSLT stylesheets from arbitrary
domains including those behind the user's firewall. This at least allows
for existence checking of these files; it's not clear how
much, if any, data could be extracted from arbitrary XML files.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to a fixed build.</p>
