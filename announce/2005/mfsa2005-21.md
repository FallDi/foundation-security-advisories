title: Overwrite arbitrary files downloading .lnk twice
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If a windows user can be convinced to download a .lnk file 
<strong>twice</strong> to the same location an attacker can overwrite 
(essentially delete) arbitrary files on the user's machine: the file 
<em>referenced</em> by the first .lnk will be overwritten by the 
second download rather than replacing the .lnk itself.
On some older versions of windows .pif and .url files can be used to
accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>If an attacker knows the user will download twice and is able to
send different content the second time then attackers could
replace the targeted file with content of their choosing. The first
.lnk would point to the target file and the second download would
contain the compromised version of the target.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not download .pif, .lnk, or .url files. If running Windows XP 
use a limited (non-administrator) account to prevent malicious 
access to critical operating system files.</p>
