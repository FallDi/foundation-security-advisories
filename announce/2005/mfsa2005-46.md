title: XBL scripts ran even when Javascript disabled
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Scripts in XBL controls from web content continued to be run even when
Javascript was disabled. By itself this causes no harm, but it could be
combined with most script-based exploits to attack people running
vulnerable versions who thought disabling javascript would protect them.</p>

<p>In the Thunderbird and Mozilla Suite mail clients Javascript is disabled by
default for protection against denial-of-service attacks and worms; this
vulnerability could be used to bypass that protection.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to a fixed version</p>
