title: Missing Install object instance checks
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The native implementations of InstallTrigger and other XPInstall-related
javascript objects did not properly validate that they were called on
instances of the correct type. By passing other objects, even raw numbers,
the javascript interpreter would jump to the wrong place in memory.
Although no proof of concept has been developed we believe this could
be exploited.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable Javascript.</p>
