title: Javascript prompt origin spoofing

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Alerts and prompts created by scripts in web pages are presented with the
generic title [JavaScript Application] which sometimes makes it difficult to know
which site created them.  A malicious page could attempt to cause a prompt
to appear in front of a trusted site in an attempt to extract information
such as passwords from the user.</p>

<p>In the fixed version these prompts will contain the hostname from the
page which created it.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not enter sensitive information into a "JavaScript Application" prompt,
they are almost never used for this purpose. If you must, first drag the
prompt on the desktop and make sure there is not a tiny window hiding
behind it.</p>
