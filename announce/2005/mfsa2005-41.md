title: Privilege escalation via DOM property overrides
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>moz_bug_r_a4 reported several exploits giving an attacker
the ability to install malicious code or steal data, requiring only
that the user do commonplace actions like click on a link or open
the context menu. The common cause in each case was privileged UI code
("chrome") being overly trusting of DOM nodes from the content window.
Scripts in the web page can override properties and methods of DOM
nodes and shadow the native values, unless steps are taken to get the
true underlying values.</p>

<p>We found that most extensions also interacted with content DOM in a
natural, but unsafe, manner.
Changes were made so that chrome code using this natural DOM coding style
will now automatically use the native DOM value if it exists without having
to use cumbersome wrapper objects.</p>

<p>Most of the specific exploits involved tricking the privileged code
into calling eval() on an attacker-supplied script string, or the equivalent
using the Script() object. Checks were added in the security manager
to make sure eval and Script objects are run with the privileges of the
context that created them, not the potentially elevated privileges of
the context calling them.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>
