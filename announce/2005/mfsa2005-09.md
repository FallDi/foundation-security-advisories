title: Browser responds to proxy auth request from non-proxy server (ssl/https)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If a proxy is configured the browser would respond to a 407 proxy auth
request from any SSL-connected server rather than only responding to
the configured proxy server. This could leak NTLM or SPNEGO credentials
outside the organization.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to the fixed version</p>
