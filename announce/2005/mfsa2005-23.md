title: Download dialog source spoofing

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The true source of a download can be disguised by using a host
name long enough that the most significant parts are truncated.
Spoofing can be made even more convincing on windows if the subdomain
labels contain a string of non-breaking space characters.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not download files from untrusted sites. Be suspicious if
the download dialog shows the file comes from a different site
than the one you are on. If the download source is a trusted
one visit that site yourself to get the file by typing the address
into the location bar rather than trust 3rd-party links to content.</p>
