title: Heap overflow possible in UTF8 to Unicode conversion
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is possible for a UTF8 string with invalid sequences to 
trigger a heap overflow of converted Unicode data. Exploitability 
would depend on the attackers ability to get the string
into the buggy converter. General web content is converted 
elsewhere but we can't rule out the possibility of a successful 
attack.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to a version that contains this fix.</p>
