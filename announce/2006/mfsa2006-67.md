<h3>Description</h3>

<p><b>shutdown</b> demonstrated that it was possible to modify a
Script object while it was executing, potentially leading to the
execution of arbitrary JavaScript bytecode.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<p>The Firefox 2.0 release is not affected by this vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.</p>
