title: 'chrome: scheme loading remote content'
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
reference remote files, which would run scripts with full privilege.
There is no known way for web content to successfully load
a chrome: url, but if a user could be convinced to do so manually
(perhaps by copying a link and pasting it into the location bar)
this could be exploited.</p>

<p class="note">Although Thunderbird shares the browser engine with
Firefox it supports no way for a mail message to load a chrome: url or
to cause one to be loaded in the browser. It is thus not vulnerable to
this flaw. The underlying Thunderbird code has been fixed in 1.5.0.5</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not copy or drag links from untrusted web content or emails. If
you must, make sure it is a normal http:, https:, or ftp: link rather than
chrome: or another uncommon type.</p>

<p>Disabling JavaScript would prevent remote chrome pages from running
any exploit code, but that should not be necessary since there is
no known way to load a chrome: url in a browser window without the user
doing so manually by entering it in the location bar.</p>
