title: Privilege escalation using addSelectionListener
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Web content could access the nsISelectionPrivate interface of the Selection
object and use it to add a SelectionListener. The listener would be called when
the user did a "Find" on the page or a "select all", and as intended this
shouldn't cause any problems. But as with escaping the PAC sandbox
in <a href="mfsa2006-31.html">MFSA 2006-31</a> and content-defined DOM setters in
<a href="mfsa2006-37.html">MFSA 2006-37</a> moz_bug_r_a4 figured a way to
leverage the fact that the notifications were created in a privileged context
into arbitrary code execution.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you've upgraded to a fixed version.</p>
