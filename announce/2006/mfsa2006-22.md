reporter: TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative
title: CSS Letter-Spacing Heap Overflow Vulnerability
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative discovered
an integer overflow triggered by the CSS letter-spacing property. This results in
in under-allocating memory and ultimately a heap buffer overflow which could
be exploited to run code of the attacker's choice.</p>

<p>The overflow condition itself does not require JavaScript
and thus could affect Thunderbird via received mail, but without
scripting to prepare memory it may not be possible to exploit
this condition in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to the fixed version.</p>
