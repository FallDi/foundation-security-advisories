title: cross-site scripting through window.controllers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>shutdown demonstrated how to use the window.controllers array
to bypass same-origin protections, allowing a malicious site to
inject script into content from another site. This could allow
the malicious page to steal information such as cookies or
passwords from the other site, or perform transactions on the user's
behalf if the user were already logged in.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a version containing the fix.</p>

<h3>References</h3>
