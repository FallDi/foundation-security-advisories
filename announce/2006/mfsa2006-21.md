title: JavaScript execution in mail when forwarding in-line
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Georgi Guninski reports that forwarding mail in-line while
using the default HTML "rich mail" editor will execute
JavaScript embedded in the e-mail message. Forwarding mail
in-line is not the default setting but it is easily accessed
through the "Forward As" menu item.</p>

<p>This JavaScript runs with the full privileges of the client
and could be used to install malware or send spam.</p>

<p>In Thunderbird 1.0.7 and below and Mozilla Suite 1.7.12 and below
JavaScript is also executed when you reply to a mail, though
limited to the sandbox of the message. This script could
spy on or alter the message you are composing.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Switch to "plain text" mail composition, this vulnerability only
affects HTML mail composition (the default). On the "Composition and 
Addressing" tab of Thunderbird's Account Settings dialog uncheck the 
"Compose messages in HTML format" option to compose messages in plain 
text.</p>
