title: Privilege escalation using watch point

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Shutdown demonstrated that it was possible to use a JavaScript
watch() to gain elevated privilege. This could be used to compromise
the user's computer and install malware.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in
mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from
running JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or the mail portion of SeaMonkey.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Exploit details withheld during the active upgrade period.</p>
