title: Security check of js_ValueToFunctionObject() can be circumvented
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The security check in js_ValueToFunctionObject() can be bypassed
by clever use of setTimeout() and the new Firefox 1.5 array method ForEach.
shutdown demonstrated how to leverage this into a privilege escalation
vulnerability that would allow the installation of malware.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, 
Firefox 1.0 and Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not affected.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until you upgrade to a fixed version.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Exploit code and details embargoed during the active update period.</p>
