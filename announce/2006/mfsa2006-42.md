title: Web site XSS using BOM on UTF-8 pages
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Masatoshi Kimura reports that the Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) is
stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode before
the parser sees the web page. As a result the parser will see and
process <code>script</code> tags that web input sanitizers may miss
because they appear as "scr[BOM]ipt" or similar in the comment code
on the web site.</p>

<p>Although Firefox 1.5.0.4 and later will be fixed and no longer
accept such script tags, web sites will continue to be visited by
older versions of Firefox and Mozilla browsers. Web sites can protect
themselves by explicitly setting the character encoding to something other
than UTF-8, or by adding the Unicode byte-order marks to the repertoire
of the site's input sanitizer.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Users can protect themselves by disabling JavaScript on sites that allow
community input until they can upgrade to a fixed version.</p>

<p>Sites can protect their users by stripping the BOM from web input
or, if appropriate, specifying a character encoding other than UTF-8.</p>
