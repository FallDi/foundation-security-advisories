<h3>Description</h3>

<p>As a privacy measure to prevent senders (primarily spammers)
from tracking when e-mail is read Thunderbird does not load
remote content referenced from an HTML mail message until a
user tells it to do so. This normally includes the content of
frames and CSS files, but CrashFr showed it was possible to
bypass this restriction through indirection: the direct
CSS or iframe src is included in-line, with that including
remote content.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Switch the "view message body as..." choice to "Simple HTML" or
"Plain text". Or for POP mail, after downloading the mail
switch to offline mode before reading any of it.</p>
