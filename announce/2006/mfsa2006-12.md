title: Secure-site spoof (requires security warning dialog)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tristor reports that it was possible to spoof the browser's secure-site
indicators (the lock icon, the site name in the URL field, the gold URL
field background in Firefox) by first loading the target secure site
in a pop-up window, then changing its location to a different site.</p>

<p>If the user has turned on the "Entering secure site" modal warning dialog
then the window location can be changed while that dialog is displayed
and the secure-browsing indicators from the original site will remain.</p>

<p>These dialogs are turned off by default in Firefox, and most Suite users
click the checkbox to turn them off.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Turn off the "Entering encrypted site" warning dialog if you have not already.</p>
