title: Remote compromise via content-defined setter on object prototypes
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Paul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an object prototype were
getting called by privileged UI code, and moz_bug_r_a4 was able to develop an
exploit PoC that demonstrated that the higher privilege level could be passed
along to the content-defined attack code.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until an upgraded version is installed. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.</p>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>Exploit details withheld until sufficient time has passed to give
users a chance to upgrade</p>
