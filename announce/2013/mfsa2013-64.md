title: Use after free mutating DOM during SetBody
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Nils</strong> used the Address Sanitizer to
discover a use-after-free problem when the Document Object Model is modified
during a SetBody mutation event. This causes a potentially exploitable
crash.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
