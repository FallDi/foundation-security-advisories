title: Crash during WAV audio file decoding
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Aki Helin</strong> from OUSPG used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a crash during the decoding of WAV format audio files
in some instances. This crash is not exploitable but could be used for a denial
of service (DOS) attack by malicious parties.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
