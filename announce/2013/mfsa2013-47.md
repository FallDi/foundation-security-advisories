title: Uninitialized functions in DOMSVGZoomEvent
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Ms2ger</strong> discovered that some
<code>DOMSVGZoomEvent</code> functions are used without being properly
initialized, causing uninitialized memory to be used when they are called by web
content. This could lead to a information leakage to sites depending on the
contents of this uninitialized memory.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
