title: Privacy leak in JavaScript Workers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>Frederik Braun</strong> discovered that
since Firefox 15 the file system location of the active browser profile was
available to JavaScript workers. While not dangerous by itself, this could
potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities to target the profile in an
attack.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
