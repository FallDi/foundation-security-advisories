title: Improper state in HTML5 Tree Builder with templates
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher <strong>Atte
Kettunen</strong> from OUSPG found that the HTML5 Tree Builder does not properly
store state when interacting with <code>template</code> elements. Because some
stack information is incorrectly stored, the template insertion mode stack can
be used when it is empty. This could possibly lead to code execution in some
circumstances.</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
