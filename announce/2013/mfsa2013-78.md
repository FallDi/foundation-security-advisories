title: Integer overflow in ANGLE library
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Alex Chapman</strong> reported that the Almost
Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE) library used by Mozilla is vulnerable to an
integer overflow. This vulnerability is present because of insufficient bounds
checking in the <code>drawLineLoop</code> function, which can be driven by web
content to overflow allocated memory, leading to a potentially exploitable
crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
