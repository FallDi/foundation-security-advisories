title: Bypass of XrayWrappers using XBL Scopes
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla Developer <strong>Bobby Holley</strong> and Mozilla security
researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> discovered a mechanism where XBL scopes
can be be used to circumvent XrayWrappers from within the Chrome on unprivileged
objects. This allows web content to potentially confuse privileged code and
weaken invariants and can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
