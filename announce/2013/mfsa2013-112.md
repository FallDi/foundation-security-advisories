title: Linux clipboard information disclosure though selection paste
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Vincent Lefevre</strong> reported that on
Linux systems, web content can access data saved to the clipboard when a user
attempts to paste a selection with a middle-click instead of pasting the
selection content. This allows for possibly private data in the clipboard to be
inadvertently disclosed to web content. Windows and OS X systems are not
affected by this issue.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
