title: Calling scope for new Javascript objects can lead to memory corruption
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Ms2ger</strong> found a mechanism where a
new Javascript object with a compartment is uninitialized could be entered
through web content. When the scope for this object is called, it leads to a
potentially exploitable crash. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
