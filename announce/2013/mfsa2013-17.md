title: Use-after-free in ListenerManager
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>regenrecht</strong> reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a use-after-free within the <code>ListenerManager</code> when garbage collection is forced after data in listener objects have been allocated in some circumstances. This results in a use-after-free which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
