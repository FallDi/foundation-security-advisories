title: Shared object library loading from writable location
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Vladimir Vukicevic</strong> reported that Firefox
for Android will optionally load a shared object (.so) library in order to
enable GL tracing. When this is occurs, it can be from a world writable
location, allowing for it to be replaced by malicious third party applications
before it is loaded by Firefox. This would allow for accessing of all Firefox
data or for malicious code to be run by Firefox. This flaw requires malicious
software to be loaded on the device and is not accessible by web content.
