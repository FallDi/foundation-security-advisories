title: Wrong principal used for validating URI for some Javascript components
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Cody Crews</strong> reported that some Javascript
components will perform checks against the wrong uniform resource identifier
(URI) before performing security sensitive actions. This will return an
incorrect location for the originator of the call. This could be used to bypass
same-origin policy, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) or the installation
of malicious add-ons from third-party pages.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
