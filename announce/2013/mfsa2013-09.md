title: Compartment mismatch with quickstubs returned values
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Boris Zbarsky</strong> reported reported a problem where jsval-returning quickstubs fail to wrap their return values, causing a compartment mismatch. This mismatch can cause garbage collection to occur incorrectly and lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
