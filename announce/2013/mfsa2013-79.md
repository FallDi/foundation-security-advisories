title: Use-after-free in Animation Manager during stylesheet cloning
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Abhishek Arya</strong> (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free problem in the Animation Manager during the cloning of
stylesheets. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
