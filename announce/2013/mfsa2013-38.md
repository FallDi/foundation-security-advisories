title: Cross-site scripting (XSS) using timed history navigations

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> reported a method to use
browser navigations through history to load an arbitrary website with that
page's baseURI property pointing to another site instead of the seemingly loaded
one. The user will continue to see the incorrect site in the addressbar of the
browser. This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or the theft of
data through a phishing attack.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
