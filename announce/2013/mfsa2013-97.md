title: Writing to cycle collected object during image decoding
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Ezra Pool</strong> reported a potentially
exploitable crash on extremely large pages. This was caused when a cycle
collected image object was released on the wrong thread during decoding,
creating a race condition.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
