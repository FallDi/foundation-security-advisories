title: GetElementIC typed array stubs can be generated outside observed typesets
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Eric Faust</strong> reported that during JavaScript compilation <code>GetElementIC</code> typed array stubs can be generated outside observed typesets. This could lead to unpredictable behavior with a potential security impact.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
