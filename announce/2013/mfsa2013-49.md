title: Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:22.0 / rv:17.0.7)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
