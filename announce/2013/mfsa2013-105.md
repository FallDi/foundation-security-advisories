title: Application Installation doorhanger persists on navigation

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Myk Melez</strong> reported that with specifically
timed page navigation, the doorhanger notification for Web App installation
could persist from one site to another without being dismissed by the
navigation. This could be used by a malicious site to trick a user into
installing an application from one site while making it appear to come from
another.
