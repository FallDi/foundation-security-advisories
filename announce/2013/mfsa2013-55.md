title: SVG filters can lead to information disclosure
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Paul Stone</strong> of <a href="http://www.contextis.co.uk/">Context Information Security</a> discovered
that timing differences in the processing of SVG format images with filters
could allow for pixel values to be read. This could potentially allow for text
values to be read across domains, leading to information disclosure.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
