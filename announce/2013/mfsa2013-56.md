title: PreserveWrapper has inconsistent behavior
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Boris Zbarsky</strong> found that when
<code>PreserveWrapper</code> was used in cases where a wrapper is not set, the
<code>preserved-wrapper</code> flag on the wrapper cache is cleared. This could
potentially lead to an exploitable crash.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
