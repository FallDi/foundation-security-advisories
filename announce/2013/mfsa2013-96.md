title: Improperly initialized memory and overflows in some JavaScript functions
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compiler Engineer <strong>Dan Gohman</strong> of Google discovered a flaw in
the JavaScript engine where memory was being incorrectly allocated for some
functions and the calls for allocations were not always properly checked for
overflow, leading to potential buffer overflows. When combined with other
vulnerabilities, these flaws could be potentially exploitable.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
