title: Web content bypass of COW and SOW security wrappers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Bobby Holley</strong> discovered that it was
possible to bypass some protections in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and System
Only Wrappers (SOW), making their prototypes mutable by web content. This could
be used leak information from chrome objects and possibly allow for arbitrary
code execution.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
