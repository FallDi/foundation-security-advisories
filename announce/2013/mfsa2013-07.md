title: Crash due to handling of SSL on threads
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Jerry Baker</strong> reported a crashing issue found through Thunderbird when downloading messages over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. This was caused by a bug in the networking code assuming that secure connections were entirely handled on the socket transport thread when they can occur on a variety of threads. The resulting crash was potentially exploitable.
</p>

<p class="note">While the initial issue was found through Thunderbird, the affected networking library is common to Mozilla code.</p>
