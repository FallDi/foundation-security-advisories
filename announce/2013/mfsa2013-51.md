title: Privileged content access and execution via XBL
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> reported that it is
possible to compile a user-defined function in the XBL scope of a specific
element and then trigger an event within this scope to run code. In some
circumstances, when this code is run, it can access content protected by System
Only Wrappers (SOW) and chrome-privileged pages. This could potentially lead to
arbitrary code execution. Additionally, Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) can be
bypassed by web content to access privileged methods, leading to a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack from privileged pages.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
