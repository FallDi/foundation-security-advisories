title: Memory corruption in str_unescape
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Scott Bell</strong> of Security-Assessment.com used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in <code>str_unescape</code> in the Javascript engine. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
