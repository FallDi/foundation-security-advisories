title: Clickjacking of certificate warning page
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security Researcher <strong>Matt McCutchen</strong> reported that a
clickjacking attack using the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate error warning
page (about:certerror) with the "Add Exception" button of a real warning page
from a malicious site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate exception
for a different site than the perceived one. This can lead to compromised
communications with the user perceived site through the MITM attack once the
certificate exception has been added.
