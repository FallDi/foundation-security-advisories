title: Some DOMWindowUtils methods bypass security checks
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Johnny Stenback</strong> discovered that several
methods of a feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected by
existing security checks, allowing these methods to be called through script by
web pages. This was addressed by adding the existing security checks to these
methods.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
