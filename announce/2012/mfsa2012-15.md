title: XSS with multiple Content Security Policy headers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security Researcher <strong>Mike Brooks</strong> of Sitewatch reported that
if multiple Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are present on a page, they
have an additive effect page policy. Using carriage return line feed (CRLF)
injection, a new CSP rule can be introduced which allows for cross-site
scripting (XSS) on sites with a separate header injection vulnerability.
</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability.
