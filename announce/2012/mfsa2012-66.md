title: HTTPMonitor extension allows for remote debugging without explicit activation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>Mark Goodwin</strong> discovered an issue
with the Firefox developer tools' debugger. If remote debugging is disabled, but
the experimental HTTPMonitor extension has been installed and enabled, a remote
user can connect to and use the remote debugging service through the port used
by HTTPMonitor. A <code>remote-enabled</code> flag has been added to resolve
this problem and close the port unless debugging is explicitly enabled.
