title: Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) does not disallow access to privileged functions
  or properties
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> reported that when
InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper
(COW) that fails to specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome privileged functions
through script.
</p>

<p>While investigating this issue, Mozilla security researcher
<strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> found that COW did not disallow accessing of
properties from a standard prototype in some situations, even when the original
issue had been fixed.
</p>

<p>These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or arbitrary
code execution. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
