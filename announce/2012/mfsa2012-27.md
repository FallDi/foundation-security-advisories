title: Page load short-circuit can lead to XSS
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> and <strong>Eddy
Bordi</strong> reported that they could short-circuit page loads to show the
address of a different site than what is loaded in the window in the addressbar.
Security researcher <strong>Chris McGowen</strong> independently reported the
same flaw, and further demonstrated that this could lead to loading scripts from
the attacker's site, leaving users vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.
