title: Content Security Policy inline-script bypass
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Adam Barth</strong> found that inline event handlers, such as onclick, were no longer blocked by Content Security
Policy's (CSP) inline-script blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected.
