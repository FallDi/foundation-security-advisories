title: Reader Mode pages have chrome privileges
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Warren He</strong> reported that when a page is
transitioned into Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly sanitized. A successful
attack requires user enabling of reader mode for a malicious page, which could
then perform an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This has been fixed by
changing the Reader Mode page into an unprivileged page.

<p class="note">This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.</p>
