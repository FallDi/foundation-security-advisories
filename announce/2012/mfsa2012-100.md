title: Improper security filtering for cross-origin wrappers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Bobby Holley</strong> reported that security wrappers filter at the time of property access, but once a function is returned, the caller can use this function without further security checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for write actions on objects when only read actions should be properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
