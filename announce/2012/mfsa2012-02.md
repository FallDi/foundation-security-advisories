title: Overly permissive IPv6 literal syntax
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For historical reasons Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If this host was not a
valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular
domain name. <strong>Gregory Fleischer</strong> reported that requests made
using IPv6 syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error messages
from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will
allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages, allowing user
privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that
may break links written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
</p>
<p class="note">This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0, and
SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during
2012.</p>
