title: Potential memory corruption during font rendering using cairo-dwrite
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security research firm <strong>iDefense</strong> reported that researcher
<strong>wushi</strong> of team509 discovered a memory corruption on Windows
Vista and Windows 7 systems with hardware acceleration disabled or using
incompatible video drivers. This is created by using cairo-dwrite to attempt to
render fonts on an unsupported code path. This corruption causes a potentially
exploitable crash on affected systems.
