title: NSS parsing errors with zero length items
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Kaspar Brand</strong> found a flaw in how the
Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items. Effects
of this issue depend on the field. One known symptom is an unexploitable crash
in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles zero-length basic constraints,
assuming default values for some types that should be rejected as malformed.
These issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4, which is now being used by
Mozilla.
