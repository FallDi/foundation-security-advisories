title: DOS and crash with full screen and history navigation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Soroush Dalili</strong> reported that a
combination of invoking full screen mode and navigating backwards in history
could, in some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing dependent
use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may be potentially exploitable.
</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.</p>
