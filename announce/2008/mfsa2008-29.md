title: Faulty .properties file results in uninitialized memory being used
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Daniel Glazman</strong> demonstrated that
an improperly encoded .properties file in an add-on can result in
uninitialized memory being used.  This could potentially result in
small chunks of data formerly used by other programs being exposed
to the add-on code. If the localized string were made available to
web content by the add-on this might leak sensitive data.</p>
