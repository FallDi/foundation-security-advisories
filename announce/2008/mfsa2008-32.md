title: Remote site run as local file via Windows URL shortcut
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>Geoff</strong> reported that URL shortcut
files on Windows (for example, saved IE favorites) could be interpreted as if
they were in the local file context when opened by Firefox, although the
referenced remote content would be downloaded and displayed. Scripts loaded
from the remote site would have access to all local file content in Firefox 2
if they were programmed to look for it.</p>

<p>Exploiting this vulnerability would involve first fooling the user into
saving such a shortcut to a malicious site--typically from some other program
since Firefox does not use this format--and then find the saved file on the
desktop and choose to open it with Firefox.</p>

<p>In affected pre-release versions of Firefox 3 the vulnerability was
further mitigated by the additional restrictions on file content that prevent
searching the local disk in this manner. Malicious scripts could only read
from files with known names stored in the same folder (or sub-folder) as
the shortcut.</p>
