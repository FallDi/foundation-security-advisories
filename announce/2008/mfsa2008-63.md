title: User tracking via XUL persist attribute
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Hish</strong> reported that
the <code>persist</code> attribute in XUL elements can be used to
store cookie-like information on a user's computer which could later
be read by a website.  This creates a privacy issue for users who have
a non-standard cookie preference and wish to prevent sites from
setting cookies on their machine.  Even with cookies turned off, this
issue could be used by a website to write persistent data in a user's
browser and track the user across browsing sessions.  Additionally,
this issue could allow a website to bypass the limits normally placed
on cookie size and number.</p>
