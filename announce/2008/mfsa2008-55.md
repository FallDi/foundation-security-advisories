<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>ling</strong> and <strong>wushi</strong> of team509, via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative program, reported a flaw in part of
Mozilla's DOM constructing code.  This vulnerability can be exploited
by modifying certain properties of a file input element before it has
finished initializing.  When the <code>blur</code> method of the
modified input element is called, uninitialized memory is accessed by
the browser, resulting in a crash.  This crash may be used by an
attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.</p>
