title: Errors parsing URLs with leading whitespace and control characters
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perl developer <strong>Chip Salzenberg</strong> reported that
certain control characters, when placed at the beginning of a URL,
would lead to incorrect parsing resulting in a malformed URL being
output by the parser.  IBM researchers <strong>Justin Schuh</strong>,
<strong>Tom Cross</strong>, and <strong>Peter William</strong> also
reported a related symptom as part of their research that resulted in
<a href="mfsa2008-37.html">MFSA 2008-37</a>.

</p><p>There was no direct security impact from this issue and its effect
was limited to the improper rendering of hyperlinks containing
specific characters.  The severity of this issue was determined to be
low.</p>
