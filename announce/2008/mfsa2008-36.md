title: Crash with malformed GIF file on Mac OS X

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Drew Yao</strong> of Apple Product Security reported a
vulnerability in Mozilla graphics code which handles GIF rendering in Mac
OS X. He demonstrated that a GIF file could be specially crafted to cause
the browser to free an uninitialized pointer. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash the browser and potentially execute arbitrary code
on the victim's computer.</p>

<p class="note">Firefox 2 is not affected by this issue.</p>
