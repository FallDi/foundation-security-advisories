title: Entering fullscreen and persistent pointerlock without user permission
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>sushi Anton Larsson</strong> reported that when paired
fullscreen and pointerlock requests are done in combination with closing windows, a
pointerlock can be created within a fullscreen window without user permission. This
pointerlock cannot then be cancelled without terminating the browser, resulting in a
persistent denial of service attack. This can also be used for spoofing and clickjacking
attacks against the browser UI.
