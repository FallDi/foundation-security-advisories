title: Local file overwriting and potential privilege escalation through CSP reports
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Nicolas Golubovic</strong> reported that a malicious page
can overwrite files on the user's machine using Content Security Policy (CSP) violation
reports. The file contents are restricted to the JSON format of the report. In many cases
overwriting a local file may simply be destructive, breaking the functionality of that
file. The CSP error reports can include HTML fragments which could be rendered by
browsers. If a user has disabled add-on signing and has installed an "unpacked" add-on, a
malicious page could overwrite one of the add-on resources. Depending on how this resource
is used, this could lead to privilege escalation.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
