title: Addressbar spoofing with right-to-left characters on Firefox for Android
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Rafay Baloch</strong> reported a mechanism to spoof the
addressbar in Firefox for Android using right-to-left character sets when combined with
left-to-right characters. This can be used to cause only certain portions of the loaded
left-to-right character portion of the URL to be displayed, misleading users as to what
site is loaded, possibly leading to phishing attacks. 
</p>

<p class="note">This vulnerability does not affect the desktop version of Firefox.</p>
