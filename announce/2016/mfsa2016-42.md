title: Use-after-free and buffer overflow in Service Workers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Looben Yang</strong> reported two issues discovered in
Service Workers using Address Sanitizer.
</p>

<p>The first of these is a use-after-free vulnerability caused by a
<code>ServiceWorkerInfo</code> object being kept active beyond the life its owning
registration. When it is later called through this registration, a use-after-free results.
</p>

<p>In the second issue, a race condition leading to a buffer overflow was found in the
<code>ServiceWorkerManager</code>. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash when
triggered. 
</p>
