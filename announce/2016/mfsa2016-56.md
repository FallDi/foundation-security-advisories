title: Use-after-free when textures are used in WebGL operations after recycle pool destruction
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>jomo</strong> reported a use-after-free crash when
processing WebGL content. This issue was caused by the use of a texture after its recycle
pool has been destroyed during WebGL operations, which frees the memory associated with
the texture. This results in a potentially exploitable crash when the texture is later
called.
