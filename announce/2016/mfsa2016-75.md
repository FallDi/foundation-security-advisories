title: Integer overflow in WebSockets during data buffering
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Samuel Groß</strong> reported an integer overflow error in
WebSockets during data buffering on incoming packets when an allocated buffer is resized
incorrectly. This results in the buffer array holding the data being shrunk, instead of
grown, resulting in attacker controlled data being written at a known offset from the
newly allocated buffer. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.
