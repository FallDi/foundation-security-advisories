title: Buffer overflow in ClearKey Content Decryption Module (CDM) during video playback
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An anonymous security researcher working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative
reported a buffer overflow in the ClearKey Content Decryption Module (CDM) used by the
Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) API. This vulnerability can be triggered using a
malformed video file due to incorrect error handling. This could allow arbitrary code
execution if combined with a second vulnerability that allows an escape from the Gecko
Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox. Without such a vulnerability, the buffer overflow is contained
within the GMP sandbox and cannot be exploited.
