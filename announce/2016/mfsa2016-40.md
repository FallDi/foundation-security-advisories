title: Privilege escalation through file deletion by Maintenance Service updater
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Holger Fuhrmannek</strong> reported an issue where the
Mozilla Maintenance Service updater on Windows can delete arbitrary files because of its
privileged system access. This file deletion can then potentially be used for further
privilege escalation. This flaw requires users to execute a locally saved file in order
for it to be triggered.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue does not affect non-Windows operating systems.</p>
