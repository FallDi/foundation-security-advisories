title: Out-of-bounds read during XML parsing in Expat library
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Gustavo Grieco</strong> reported a potential out-of-bounds
read parsing malformed XML data during character conversion. This is due to a bug in the
Expat library, which is used in Firefox. This could allow an attacker to read other
inaccessible memory.
