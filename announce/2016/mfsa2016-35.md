title: Buffer overflow during ASN.1 decoding in NSS
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Francis Gabriel</strong> of Quarkslab reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in the way the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries parsed certain
ASN.1 structures. An attacker could create a specially-crafted certificate which, when
parsed by NSS, would cause it to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user.
</p>

<p>This issue has been addressed in the NSS releases shipping on affected Mozilla
products:<p>
<ul>
    <li>Firefox ESR 38.7 has been updated to 3.19.2.3.</li>
    <li>Firefox 45 has been updated to 3.21.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects using NSS 3.21 should update the new 3.21.1 release.</p>
