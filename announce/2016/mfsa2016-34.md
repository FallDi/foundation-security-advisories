title: Out-of-bounds read in HTML parser following a failed allocation
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ronald Crane</strong> reported an out-of-bounds read
following a failed allocation in the HTML parser while working with unicode strings. This
can also affect the parsing of XML and SVG format data. This leads to a potentially
exploitable crash. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
