title: Information disclosure and local file manipulation through drag and drop
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Rafael Gieschke</strong> reported that file URIs dragged
from a web page in Firefox to other software do not have their contents properly filtered
before being passed to other programs, such as the local file manager. This can allow for
the theft or manipulation of arbitrary local files if a user can be convinced to drag
items from a malicious web page to other programs.
