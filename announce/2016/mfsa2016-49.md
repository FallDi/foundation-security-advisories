title: Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:47.0 / rv:45.2)

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers and community members reported several memory safety bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed
evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough
effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
