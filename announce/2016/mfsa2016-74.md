title: Form input type change from password to text can store plain text password in session restore file
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla employee <strong>Mike Kaply</strong> reported that the Firefox session restore
data can contain passwords in plain text if a password input field on a page has its type
changed from "password" to "text" during a session. This can occur if the password input
field has a scripted mechanism to display the password to the user. Once this type is
changed, the password data will persist as clear text within stored form data for this
page. This could result in a potential revelation of site passwords on sites that use this
mechanism to display password data if an attacker could find a way to read the session
restoration file.
