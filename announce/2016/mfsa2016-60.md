title: Java applets bypass CSP protections
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla engineer <strong>Matt Wobensmith</strong> reported that Content Security Policy
(CSP) does not block the loading of cross-domain Java applets when specified by policy.
This is because the Java applet is loaded by the Java plugin, which then mediates all
network requests without checking against CSP. This could allow a malicious site to
manipulate content through a Java applet to bypass CSP protections, allowing for possible
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
