title: Disclosure of user actions through JavaScript with motion and orientation sensors

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Maryam Mehrnezhad</strong> of Newcastle University, UK
reported an issue discovered by their research team, which also includes Ehsan Toreini,
Siamak F. Shahandashti, and Feng Hao. They found vulnerabilities in Firefox for Android
using orientation data and motion sensors on a mobile device's browser accessible
through JavaScript. This allows an attacker to infer touch actions on the device through
these sensors when orientation events are triggered in the browser, compromising user
privacy and including potentially revealing entered PIN code data along with other user
activities.

<p class="note">This issue does not affect desktop versions of Firefox.</p>
