title: Information disclosure of disabled plugins through CSS pseudo-classes
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>John Schoenick</strong> reported that CSS pseudo-classes can
be used by web content to leak information on plugins that are installed but disabled.
This can be used for information disclosure through a fingerprinting attack that lists all
of the plugins installed by a user on a system, even when they are disabled.
