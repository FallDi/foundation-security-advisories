title: Lightweight themes on Firefox for Android do not verify a secure connection
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Margaret Leibovic</strong> reported when Firefox for
Android installs lightweight themes, it does not check to verify that they are served over
an HTTPS connection. Instead, themes can be installed over an unencrypted connection,
which could allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by third parties replacing the
theme content, which consists of images and toolbar text colors.
