    title: Data from Pocket server improperly sanitized before execution
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Wladimir Palant

  CVE-2016-9902:
    title: Pocket extension does not validate the origin of events
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Wladimir Palant
    description: |
      The Pocket toolbar button, once activated, listens for events fired from it's own pages but does not verify the origin of incoming events. This allows content from other origins to fire events and inject content and commands into the Pocket context. <br>*Note: this issue does not affect users with e10s enabled.*

  CVE-2016-9893:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Jan de Mooij, Iris Hsiao, Christian Holler, Carsten Book, Timothy Nikkel, Christoph Diehl, Olli Pettay, Raymond Forbes, and Boris Zbarsky reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.0.2 and Firefox ESR 45.5.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
