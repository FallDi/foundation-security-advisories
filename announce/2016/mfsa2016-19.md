title: Linux video memory DOS with Intel drivers
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ucha Gobejishvili</strong> reported a denial of service
(DOS) attack when doing certain WebGL operations in a canvas requiring an unusually large
amount buffer to be allocated from video memory. This resulted in memory resource
exhaustion with some Intel video cards, requiring the computer to be rebooted to return
functionality. This was resolved by putting in additional checks on the amount of memory
to be allocated during graphics processing.</p>

<p class="note">This issue was limited to a subset of Intel drivers on Linux. Other
operating systems were not affected.</p>
