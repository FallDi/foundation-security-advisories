title: Missing delay following user click events in protocol handler dialog
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>window</strong> reported an issue where the protocol
handler dialog appears, double click events are treated as two single click events. This was caused by the lack of a delay following the initial focus in the file download dialog. This could cause a second dialog to be sent the second click, leading to unintentional user initiated actions, such as the running of downloaded software from a maliciously positioned prompt.
