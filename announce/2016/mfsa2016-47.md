title: Write to invalid HashMap entry through JavaScript.watch()
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <strong>CESG</strong>, the Information Security Arm of GCHQ, reported that the
JavaScript <code>.watch()</code> method could be used to overflow the 32-bit generation
count of the underlying HashMap, resulting in a write to an invalid entry. Under the right
conditions this write could lead to arbitrary code execution. The overflow takes
considerable time and a malicious page would require a user to keep it open for the
duration of the attack.
