    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 50 and Firefox ESR 45.5
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Ehsan Akhgari, Jon Coppeard, Gary Kwong, Tooru Fujisawa, Philipp, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 49 and Firefox ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
