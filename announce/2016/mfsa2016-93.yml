    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Ehsan Akhgari, Jon Coppeard, Gary Kwong, Tooru Fujisawa, Philipp, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
