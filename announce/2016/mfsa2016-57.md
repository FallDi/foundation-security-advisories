title: Incorrect icon displayed on permissions notifications
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Tim McCormack</strong> reported that when a page requests a
series of permissions in a short timespan, the resulting permission notifications can show
the icon for the wrong permission request. This can lead to user confusion and inadvertent
consent given when a user is prompted by web content to give permissions, such as for
geolocation or microphone access.
