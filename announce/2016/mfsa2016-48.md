title: Firefox Health Reports could accept events from untrusted domains
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla engineer <strong>Mark Goodwin</strong> discovered that the Firefox Health
Report (<code>about:healthreport</code>) accepts certain events from any content document
present in the remote-report iframe. If there were another vulnerability that allowed the
injection of web content into the Firefox Health Report iframe, this content could change
the sharing preferences of a user by firing the appropriate events at it	s containing
page.
