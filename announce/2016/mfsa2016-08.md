title: Delay following click events in file download dialog too short on OS X
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> reported an issue on OS X where the delay between the download dialog getting focus and the button getting enabled was too short. If an attacker is able to induce the user to double-click in a specific location, they can then pass the second click through to the dialog below, leading to unintentional actions such as the running of downloaded software.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects OS X installations. Windows, Linux, and Android
installations are unaffected by it.</p>
