title: Use-after-free in service workers with nested sync events
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Looben Yang</strong> discovered a use-after-free
vulnerability when working with nested sync event loops in Service Workers. He discovered
a mechanism where scripts can close their own worker, which will then trigger a
synchronization XMLHttpRequest on this now closed and released worker. This results in a
potentially exploitable crash when triggered.
