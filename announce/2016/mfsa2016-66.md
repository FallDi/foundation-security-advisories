title: Location bar spoofing via data URLs with malformed/invalid mediatypes
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Firas Salem</strong> reported that decoding url-encoded
values in <code>data:</code> urls for display leads to potential spoofing in the Location
bar by using non-ASCII and emoji characters in a <code>data:</code> url's mediatype. This
issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users
to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.
