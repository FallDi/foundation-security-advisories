title: Same-origin policy violation using local HTML file and saved shortcut file
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Abdulrahman Alqabandi</strong> reported that when a local
HTML file resides in the same directory as a malicious local shortcut file, the shortcut
can be called by the local page to allow the page to read the contents of local files or
directories or to load an arbitrary website in violation of same-origin policy, allowing
for data theft. In order for this vulnerability to be triggered, both the malicious HTML
file as well as the shortcut must be saved to the same local directory and then loaded
from there by a user.
