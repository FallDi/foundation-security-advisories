title: Memory corruption when modifying a file being read by FileReader
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Oriol</strong> reported memory corruption when local files
are modified (by either the user or another program) at the same time being read using the
<code>FileReader</code> API. This flaw requires that input be taken from a local file in
order to be triggered and cannot be triggered by web content. This results in a
potentially exploitable crash when triggered.
