title: Same-origin-policy violation using Service Workers with plugins
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Jason Pang</strong> of OneSignal reported that service workers
intercept responses to plugin network requests made through the browser.
Plugins which make security decisions based on the content of network requests
can have these decisions subverted if a service worker forges responses to those
requests. For example, a forged <code>crossdomain.xml</code> could allow a
malicious site to violate the same-origin policy using the Flash plugin.
