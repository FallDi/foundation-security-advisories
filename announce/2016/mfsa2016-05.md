title: Addressbar spoofing through stored data url shortcuts on Firefox for Android
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Muneaki Nishimura</strong> reported an issue with displayed URLs and bookmarks on Firefox for Android. If a <code>data:</code> URL is opened from a stored shortcut on the homescreen or from a BOOKMARK intent from another installed Android application, the addressbar continues to show the <code>data:</code> url even if the content redirects to another page, hiding the true origin of the content. This was due to an error in how hosts were handled with <code>data:</code> URLs.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Firefox on other operating
systems is not affected.</p>
