  CVE-2016-9893:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 45.6
    impact: critical
    reporter: Mozilla developers
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Jan de Mooij, Iris Hsiao, Christian Holler, Carsten Book, Timothy Nikkel, Christoph Diehl, Olli Pettay, Raymond Forbes, and Boris Zbarsky reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
