    title:   |
      data: URL can inherit wrong origin after an HTTP redirect
    impact: critical
    reporter: Alexander Inf√ºhr
    description:  |
      Redirection from an HTTP connection to a <code>data:</code> URL assigns the referring site's origin to the <code>data:</code> URL in some circumstances. This can result in same-origin violations against a domain if it loads resources from malicious sites. Cross-origin setting of cookies has been demonstrated without the ability to read them. <br>*Note: This issue only affects Firefox 49 and 50.*
