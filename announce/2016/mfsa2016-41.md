title: Content provider permission bypass allows malicious application to access data
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ken Okuyama</strong> reported an issue on Firefox for
Android where a previously installed malicious application can access content provider
permissions for Firefox in order to read data. This data includes browser history and
locally saved passwords. This issue occurs when a list of permissions is defined to match
those that Firefox uses for content providers and bypasses signature protections. This
issue does not occur on Android 5.0 or later versions of Android.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating
systems are unaffected.</p>
