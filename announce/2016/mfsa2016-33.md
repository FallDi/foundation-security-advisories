<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ronald Crane</strong> reported a race condition in
<code>GetStaticInstance</code> in WebRTC which results in a use-after-free. This could
result in a potentially exploitable crash. This issue was found through code inspection
and does not have clear mechanism to be exploited through web content but is vulnerable if
a mechanism can be found to trigger it.
