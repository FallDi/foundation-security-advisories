title: Clickjacking through cursor invisability after Flash interaction
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> reported a mechanism where
the cursor can be rendered invisible after it has been used on an embedded flash
object when used outside of the object. This flaw can be in used in combination
with an image of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to
clickjacking during interactions with HTML content subsequently. This issue only
affects OS X and is not present on Windows or Linux systems.
