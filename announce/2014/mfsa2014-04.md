title: Incorrect use of discarded images by RasterImage
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Fredrik 'Flonka' LÃ¶nnqvist</strong> discovered an issue with image
decoding in <code>RasterImage</code> caused by continued use of discarded
images. This could allow for the writing to unowned memory and a potentially
exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
