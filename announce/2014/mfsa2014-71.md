title: 'Profile directory file access through file: protocol'
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Yu Dongsong</strong> reported on Firefox for
Android that a <code>file:</code> protocol hyperlink could link to a local file
in the Firefox profile directory, bypassing access restrictions. This issue was
previously addressed in <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-33.html">Mozilla
Foundation Security Advisory 2014-33</a> but not completely.</p>

<p>This problem allows for profile data, such as cookies, to be copied to the SD
card without prompting to the use. This SD card location is world readable
leading to a potential information disclosure of files in the Firefox profile
through a malicious application.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue only affects Firefox for Android.</p>
