title: Use-after-free interacting with text directionality
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>regenrecht</strong> reported, via TippingPoint's
Zero Day Initiative, a use-after-free during text layout when interacting with
text direction. This results in a crash which can lead to arbitrary code
execution. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
