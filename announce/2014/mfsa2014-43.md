title: Cross-site scripting (XSS) using history navigations
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>moz_bug_r_a4</strong> reported a method
to use browser navigations through history to load a website with that page's
baseURI property pointing to that of another site instead of the seemingly
loaded one. The user will continue to see the incorrect site in the addressbar
of the browser. This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or the theft
of data through a phishing attack. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
