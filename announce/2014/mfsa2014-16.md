title: Files extracted during updates are not always read only

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ash</strong> reported an issue where the
extracted files for updates to existing files are not read only during the
update process. This allows for the potential replacement or modification of
these files during the update process if a malicious application is present on
the local system.
