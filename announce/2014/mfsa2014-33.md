<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Roee Hay</strong> reported that a hyperlink using
the <code>file:</code> protocol on Firefox for Android could link to a local
file in the Firefox profile directory. If a user selected this link on their
device, the linked file would be copied to the SD card without prompting.
This SD card location is world readable leading to a potential information
disclosure of files in the Firefox profile through a malicious application.
