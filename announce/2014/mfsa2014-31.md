title: Out-of-bounds read/write through neutering ArrayBuffer objects
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>JÃ¼ri Aedla</strong>, via TippingPoint's
Pwn2Own contest, reported that <code>TypedArrayObject</code> does not handle the
case where <code>ArrayBuffer</code> objects are neutered, setting their length
to zero while still in use. This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes into
the JavaScript heap, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
