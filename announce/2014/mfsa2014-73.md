title: RSA Signature Forgery in NSS
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>Antoine Delignat-Lavaud</strong>, security researcher at Inria Paris
in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries
affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a
signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is
due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to
the forging of RSA certificates.</p>

<p>The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently
discovered and reported this issue.</p>

<p>These have been addressed in the NSS releases shipping on affected Mozilla
products:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firefox ESR 31.1.1, Firefox ESR 24.8.1, Thunderbird 31.1.1, and
Thunderbird 24.8.1 have been updated to NSS 3.16.2.1.</li>
	<li>Firefox 32.0.3 and SeaMonkey 2.29.1 have been updated to 3.16.5.</li>
</ul>	

<p>Projects using NSS 3.17 should update the new 3.17.1 release.</p>
