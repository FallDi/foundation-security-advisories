title: Web Audio memory corruption issues with custom waveforms
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Holger Fuhrmannek</strong> used the used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover an out-of-bounds read issue with Web Audio
when interacting with custom waveforms with invalid values. This results in a
crash and could allow for the reading of random memory which may contain
sensitive data, or of memory addresses that could be used in combination with
another bug.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
