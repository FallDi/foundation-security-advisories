title: Inconsistent video sharing within iframe
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers <strong>Eric Shepherd</strong> and <strong>Jan-Ivar
Bruaroey</strong> reported issues with privacy and video sharing using WebRTC.
Once video sharing has started within a WebRTC session running within an
<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, video will continue to be shared even if the user
selects the &amp;quote;Stop Sharing" button in the controls. The camera will
also remain on even if the user navigates to another site and will begin
streaming again if the user returns to the original site. This is a privacy
problem and can lead to inadvertent video streaming. This does not affect
implementations that are not within an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
