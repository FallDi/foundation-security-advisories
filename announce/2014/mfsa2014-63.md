title: Use-after-free while when manipulating certificates in the trusted cache
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researchers <strong>Tyson Smith</strong> and <strong>Jesse
Schwartzentruber</strong> used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to
discover a use-after-free error resulting in a crash. This is a result of a pair
of <code>NSSCertificate</code> structures being added to a trust domain and then
one of them is removed while they are still in use by the trusted cache. This
crash is potentially exploitable.
</p>

<p>This issue was addressed in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Overview_of_NSS">Network Security Services (NSS) library</a> in version 3.16.2, 
shipping on affected platforms.</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
