title: Use-after-free during HTML5 parsing
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>SkyLined</strong> reported a use-after-free created by triggering the creation of a second root element while parsing HTML written to a document created with <code>document.open()</code>. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash.</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
