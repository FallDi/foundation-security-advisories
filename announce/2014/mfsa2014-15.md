title: Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:28.0 / rv:24.4)
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developers and community identified identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these
could be exploited to run arbitrary code.</p>

<p class="note">In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
