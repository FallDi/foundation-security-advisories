title: Use-after-free in DirectWrite font handling
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>James Kitchener</strong> reported a crash in
DirectWrite when rendering MathML content with specific fonts due to an error in
how font resources and tables are handled. This leads to use-after-free of a
DirectWrite font-face object, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">This issue is limited to the Windows platform and does not
affect OS X or Linux systems. In general this flaw cannot be exploited through 
email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially 
a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
