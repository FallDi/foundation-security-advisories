title: Privilege escalation through Web Notification API
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Mariusz Mlynski</strong> discovered an issue
where sites that have been given notification permissions by a user can bypass
security checks on source components for the Web Notification API. This allows
for script to be run in a privileged context through notifications, leading to
arbitrary code execution on these sites.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
