title: Privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service Installer
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Ash</strong> reported an issue affected the
Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows systems. The Mozilla Maintenance Service
installer writes to a temporary directory created during the update process
which is writable by users. If malicious DLL files are placed within this
directory during the update process, these DLL files can run in a privileged
context through the Mozilla Maintenance Service's privileges, allowing for local
privilege escalation. 
</p>

<p class="note">This issue does not affect Linux or OS X users and is confined
to Windows.</p>
