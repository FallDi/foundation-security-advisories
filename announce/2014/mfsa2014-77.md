title: Out-of-bounds write with WebM video
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher <strong>Abhishek
Arya</strong> (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team found an
out-of-bounds write when buffering WebM format video containing frames with
invalid tile sizes. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash during WebM
video playback.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
