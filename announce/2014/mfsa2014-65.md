title: Certificate parsing broken by non-standard character encoding
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla security researcher <strong>Christian Holler</strong> discovered
several issues while fuzzing the parsing of SSL certificates. Two of these
issues were a result of using characters that are not UTF-8 in certificates when
various functions expected all strings to be UTF-8 format. The third issue was a
result of using characters that were not ASCII in certificates while a function
expected only ASCII formatted text. All of these issues causes the certificates
to be incorrectly parsed, leading to a potential inability to use valid SSL
certificates.
