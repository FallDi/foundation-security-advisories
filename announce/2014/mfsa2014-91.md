title: Privileged access to security wrapped protected objects
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Bobby Holley</strong> discovered two issues
involving security wrappers.</p>

<p>The first of these issues occurs when XrayWrappers filter object properties.
When validation of the object initially occurs, one set of object properties
will appear to be available. Later, when the XrayWrappers are removed, a more
expansive set of properties is available. These are then stored without further
validation, making these properties available and bypassing security protections
that would normally protect them from access.
</p>

<p>The second issue occurs when chrome objects are protected by Chrome Object
Wrappers (COW) and are passed as native interfaces. If this is done with some
methods, normally protected objects may be accessible to native methods exposed
to web content.
</p>

<p>Both of these issues could allow web content to access DOM objects that are
intended to be chrome-only.
