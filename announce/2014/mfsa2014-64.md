title: Crash in Skia library when scaling high quality images
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla community member <strong>John</strong> reported a crash in the Skia
library when scaling high quality images if the scaling operation takes too
long. This is caused by the image data being discarded while still in use by the
scaling operation. This crash is potentially exploitable on some systems. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
