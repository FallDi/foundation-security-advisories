title: XBL bindings accessible via improper CSS declarations
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Cody Crews</strong> reported a method to trigger
chrome level XML Binding Language (XBL) bindings through web content. This was
possible because some chrome accessible CSS stylesheets had their primary
namespace improperly declared. When this occurred, it was possible to use these
stylesheets to manipulate XBL bindings, allowing web content to bypass security
restrictions. This issue was limited to a specific set of stylesheets.
