title: Buffer overflow during Web Audio buffering for playback
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher <strong>Atte
Kettunen</strong> from OUSPG discovered a buffer overflow during interaction
with the Web Audio buffer for playback because of an error in the the amount of
allocated memory for buffers. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash with
some audio content.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
