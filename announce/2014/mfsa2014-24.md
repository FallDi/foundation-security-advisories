<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Firefox for Android includes a Crash Reporter which sends crash data to
Mozilla for analysis. Security researcher <strong>Roee Hay</strong> reported
that third party Android applications could launch the crash reporter with their
own arguments. Normally applications cannot read the private files of another
application, but this vulnerability allowed a malicious application to specify a
local file in the Firefox profile and it to its own server leading to
information disclosure. The crash reporter can also be invoked in a manner
causing an immediate crash of Firefox, leading to a potential denial of service
(DOS) attack.
