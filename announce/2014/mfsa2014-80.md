title: Key pinning bypasses
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Patrick McManus</strong> reported a method to use
SPDY or HTTP/2 connection coalescing to bypass key pinning on different sites
that resolve to the same IP address.This could allow the use of a fraudulent certificate when a saved pin for that subdomain should have prevented the connection. This leads to possible man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker has control of the DNS connection and the ability to obtain a fraudulent certificate that browsers would accept in the absence of the pin.
</p>

<p>Mozilla security engineer <strong>David Keeler</strong> discovered that when
there are specific problems verifying the issuer of an SSL certificate, the
checks necessary for key pinning would not be run. As a result, the user is then
presented with the "Untrusted Connection" error page, which they can use to bypass the key pinning process on a site that should be pinned. This error message is always shown to the user and cannot be used to silently bypass key pinning on affected sites.
</p>

<p class="note">Key pinning was first introduced in Firefox 32 and currently only covers a small number of built-in sites.</p>
