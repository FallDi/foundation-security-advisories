title: IFRAME sandbox same-origin access through redirect
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Boris Zbarsky</strong> discovered an issue where
network-level redirects cause an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> sandbox to forget 
its unique origin and behave as if the <code>allow-same-origin</code> keyword 
were applied. This allows the sandboxed content to access other content from 
the same origin without explicit approval. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
