title: Inconsistent JavaScript handling of access to Window objects
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mozilla developer <strong>Boris Zbarsky</strong> reported an inconsistency
with the different JavaScript engines in how JavaScript native getters on
<code>window</code> objects are handled by these engines. This inconsistency can
lead to different behaviors in JavaScript code, allowing for a potential
security issue with window handling by bypassing of some security checks. 
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
