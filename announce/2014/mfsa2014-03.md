title: UI selection timeout missing on download prompts
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Jordi Chancel</strong> reported that the dialog
for saving downloaded files did not implement a security timeout before button
selections were processed. This could be used in concert with spoofing to
convince users to select a different option than intended, causing downloaded
files to be potentially opened instead of only saved in some circumstances.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Seamonkey product because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a
risk in browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
