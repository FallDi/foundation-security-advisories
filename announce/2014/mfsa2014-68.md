title: Use-after-free during DOM interactions with SVG
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Abhishek Arya</strong> (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free during cycle collection. This was found in interactions with the
SVG content through the document object model (DOM) with animating SVG content.
This leads to a potentially exploitable crash.
</p>

<p class="note">In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.</p>
